                <p class="blog-post-meta">April 17, 2022 by <a href="#">David</a></p>
                <p>University policy dictates that upon receiving a positive test for Coronavirus, students must self-isolate for 7-14 days. This being the case, students who are unable to isolate at their residence are forced into isolation dorms the university has set aside. Students describe conditions as “awesome” and “the best part of my college experience.”
                <br><br>
                “I had my own room, food was delivered to me daily, and I didn’t have to take any tests,” said Charlene, just after leaving isolation. “Now that I’m back in society I’m struggling to catch up with my classwork and I can’t help but think that it was better there.”
                <br><br>
                The conditions are so “awesome” that one student, Jeff, refuses to leave, saying “I’ve found inner peace in here, while laying in bed watching anime,” Reportedly, the university is forcing Jeff out as soon as they can find security guards willing to enter the COVID dorm, but Jeff says that in this eventuality, he will just do his best to contract COVID again.

                        In Champaign, bars only allow entry to people 19 or older during bar hours. However, people under the age of 21 in Illinois are not legally allowed to buy or possess alcohol. Thus, while 19 and 20 year olds can legally enter bars, if they do, they have to stand around soberly. To an outside observer, this prospect seems pretty dull.
                        <br><br>
                        It isn’t dull to Michael, who will turn 19 on April 10th. “I just can't wait to go to Joe’s and stand in a non-intoxicated manner! I’ll have so much fun dancing and talking, all without drinking. Then, at maybe 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning I’ll leave and go to Fat Sandwich while being sober as a judge,” said the soon to be 19-year old.
                        <br><br>
                        While Michael’s enthusiasm may be perplexing, even more perplexing is the prevalence of his attitude. Several other students claimed to want to go to bars, despite being below the legal age of consumption of alcohol.

                        Our reporters are excellent at detective work, but some mysteries are too difficult to unravel. Perhaps this is a case of group insanity, or perhaps there is something deeper at play. Only time will tell.

                        </h3>

                            This Saturday, Villanova beat Houston in a 50-44 game, knocking the Cougars out of March Madness. In this dominating performance, the Wildcats played solidly and kept their lead throughout the whole game. Yesterday, Kansas won the whole tournament.
                            <br><br>
                            Despite this, Craig, the winner of your March Madness bracket pool, remains very smug that he predicted Houston would go to the end, exclaiming, “I knew from the beginning Houston had potential.”
                            <br><br>
                            Reportedly, Craig has been saying the following to anyone who would listen: “A lot of my fellow students were upset with me when they saw I predicted Illinois would lose in the second round against Houston. I think if they wanted to win the bracket pool, they shouldn’t have looked at our school's chances with rose-tinted glasses. That’s all I’m saying.”
                            <br><br>
                            Some other students have described Craig as “a jerk” and “the guy with the least school spirit in our pool,” but Craig maintains that he “was just being realistic.”

                        Following his victory in the 2022 Illinois Student Government elections, the Student Body President Elect Garret Forrest, along with running mate Vindhya Kalipi, organized a rally on the quad yesterday to thank their supporters.
                        <br><br>
                        Portions of his speech were dedicated to the outpouring of support from supporters that carried him to victory, as well as a bold reaffirmation of his campaign promises. He then mingled with the crowd, and personally shook every hand, a task made much easier by the fact that there were zero other people in attendance.
                        <br><br>
                        “I’m so grateful to you all,” the president-elect said to nobody. “It’s all thanks to your support that I’m here!”, said the man standing on the quad, shouting to an empty crowd.
                        <br><br>
                        While giving his speech, a handful of students walked by. We questioned one of them, Annie, to see her thoughts on the direction Garret Forrest is taking our student body. She answered our question with two questions: “Who is Garret Forrest? And since when did we have a student government?”
                        <br><br>
                        Our correspondent leaves us with a few more questions themselves. If a politician makes a promise, and no one cares to hear it, did the promise ever mean anything? And where the hell did Forrest get all those fireworks and parade floats from?
