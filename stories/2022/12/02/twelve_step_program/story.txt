Out of Shape Sophomore Creates a 12 Step Program to Get Fit


Obesity is an epidemic that flies under the radar on a college campus. Living in a place where dining halls are all you can eat and alcohol is the main coping mechanism doesn’t tend to do wonders for your BMI. Knowing that these things are massive issues, we talked to one student determined to fight the problem. 
Ashley, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, put her knowledge to use and devised a novel 12 step program to help students get back in shape. “My new program is an incredibly simple 12 steps. These steps really are the path you need to take to get fit. All you have to do is climb one step after another, and eventually you get to the place that fit people go.”
When asked how she thought of these 12 steps, Ashley responded, “It’s simple really. There are 12 steps in front of the ARC entrance.”
