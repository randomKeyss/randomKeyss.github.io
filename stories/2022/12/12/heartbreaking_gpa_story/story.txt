Heartbreaking: The Only Professor for This Class Is on the Bottom of the GPA Visualization


Michael, a sophomore, barely survived his finals. Now that he has a moment to breathe, he started to scope out his professors for next semester. Hoping that doing his due diligence a bit late wouldn’t screw him over, Michael checked the GPA Visualization for his classes, only to find the only professor for his class has a 2.10 average GPA. Every other professor boasted a 3.0 or above average GPA.
“I would take it next semester but I really need the prereq,” Michael said tearfully. “I really have to take this class.” Desperate for a ray of hope, Michael did some more research.
“Some Reddit user says his sections are really easy, but his comment has like 20 downvotes. He has a 0.69 quality rating and a 4.20 difficulty rating on Rate My Professors. That better be a joke. One of my friends knows someone who took the class, and he says I’m screwed.”
After hearing this heartbreaking news, Michael can be found walking home in the rain, tears streaming down his face, yelling “WHYYYY???”
