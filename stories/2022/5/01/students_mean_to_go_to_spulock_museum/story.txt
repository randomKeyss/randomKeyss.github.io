Students Mean to Go to the Spurlock Museum Sometime. They Never Will


Josh and Maria are two seniors who, for the bulk of their college experience, have said that they mean to go to the Spurlock Museum sometime. After nearly four years and countless perfect opportunities, they are struggling to admit that they are never going to go.
“We just need to find a good time to go,” said Josh, while sitting outside of KoFusion, doing nothing. “I would go now, but I’m not sure what their hours are, and whether Maria is free.” Maria, sitting next to Josh while watching reruns of Friends on her phone, absentmindedly said, “The Spurlock Museum sounds so cool, we totally have to go there sometime.”
With only two weeks left in Josh and Maria’s final semester at UIUC, the chances that they ever see the carefully crafted cultural exhibits in the Museum are looking slimmer than ever.
