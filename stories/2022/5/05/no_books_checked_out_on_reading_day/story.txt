No Books Checked Out on Reading Day


A buzz overtook the Main LIbrary as the hour approached midnight. The librarians scrambled to prepare for the expected rush of students overtaking the stacks as reading day approached. Yet as the Bell Tower’s chimes marked the beginning of reading day, no students came.
“I was really excited because this was the one day in the semester where we were going to have the spotlight, you know,” said Lucy, a newly hired librarian at the Main Library. “I thought reading day was for reading books. I’m just a little disappointed, is all.”
Throughout the course of the day, students trickled in and out of the library, but they all sat at tables studying instead of checking out and reading books. Lucy reportedly left work early, dejected yet deep in her heart not surprised.
