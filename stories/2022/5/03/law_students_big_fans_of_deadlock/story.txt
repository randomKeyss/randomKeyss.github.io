Law Students Big Fans of Congressional Deadlock


Being a law major is tough. There are almost 250 years of laws to study, and laws make dense reading. However, in recent years Congress has decided to take it easy on these poor students, who are reportedly  “thrilled by congressional deadlock”.
One law student, James, commented, “I’d just like to say that I really like and respect our current Congress for doing nothing. Now the midterm elections are coming up and these sleazy new upstarts are talking about getting stuff done. These guys gotta learn how to take it easy.”
When asked about her thoughts on Congressional productivity, another student, Michelle, remarked, “The filibuster has been the greatest thing that’s happened to this country. I fully support abolishing attempts to abolish the filibuster”
