Breaking: The Chess Board in the Altgeld Display Case is Set Up Sideways


The news just broke that the chess board in an Altgeld display case is set up sideways. Details on the story are sparse, but our correspondent on the scene notes that he’s pretty sure that white’s kingside rook should be on a white square.
If confirmed, this news would bring massive shame to the Altgeld Display Case Committee, which is still smarting from the widespread criticism following their decision not to display any suits of armor or to replace the building’s doors with drawbridges. One outraged student remarked, “First they don’t display any sweet Midievel stuff, then they mess up the chessboard! What’s next, they're going to display the Navier-Stokes equations but mix up a dot product with a cross product? This is ridiculous!”
With their sadly non-drawbridge doors closing just minutes after our correspondent arrived at the scene, we must wait until tomorrow to see how the story unfolds.
