Following Recent Technological Breakthrough in Lab Window, Scientists Promise to Be More Careful with Lab Equipment


Our science correspondent reports that there was a massive breakthrough in a lab this morning. “Eureka!” scientists shrieked as they shattered barriers previously known to be solid. “We just like pushing things to their limits as fast as we can,” explained a sheepish scientist in an oversized lab coat.
Not everyone is so excited about this development, though. This breakthrough has triggered some calls to rein in progress. “When my coworker first started making headway towards the lab window with his research, I told him that I don’t think this step is the right direction. Nevertheless, he pressed on,” said a skeptical scientist. “I just wish we could think through the ramifications of our actions.”
“Sometimes I get so preoccupied with thinking about whether I can smash barriers, I forget to think about whether I should.” In the future, I promise to be more careful.
