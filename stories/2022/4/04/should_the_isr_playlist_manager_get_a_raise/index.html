    <H2>Opinion: Should The ISR Dining Hall Playlist Manager Be Given a "Fat Raise"?</H2>
    <h5> </h5>
    <p>ISR is considered by many to be the nicest dorm in the University. It only takes a glance at the décor to tell it’s expensive, and it only takes a glance at the students to tell they’re all engineers. But venture beyond the lobby with the tastefully placed couches, and you will hear a debate raging over the sound of “Gangsta’s Paradise”. A single question rings loudly: does the playlist manager deserve a fat raise or to be discharged dishonorably?
<br><br>
We interviewed some students on the scene, and over the sound of “Cotton Eye Joe”, Susanne disgustedly said, "Play a radio station or something. If you want to listen to your motley playlist of nostalgic but obnoxious hits, put in headphones. Why do we have to be subjected to this?"
<br><br>
We also asked Carl, a freshman mechanical engineering major, whether ISR’s playlist manager is doing a good job. With “Life is a Highway” playing in the background, Carl simply retorted: "The music sorta slaps. Give that man a fat raise."
