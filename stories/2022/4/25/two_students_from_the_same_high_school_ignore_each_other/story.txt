Two Students From the Same High School Successfully Ignore Each Other


Leslie and Sarah both went to the same high school. They were in the same chemistry class their sophomore year, the same math class their junior year, and the same English class their senior year. However, the two students never had a conversation of more than 10 seconds with each other in the three years they went to high school together.
Now, the pair are living on the same floor of their dorm, and Leslie passes Sarah every day on her walk to Physics 212. For many, being in such close proximity would lead to some amount of awkward small talk, but not for Sarah and Leslie. When asked how she manages this, Sarah said, “I just pretend not to recognise her. It’s really easy because she changed her hairstyle and lost a few pounds since high school, so I can imagine she’s a completely different person.”
We also asked Leslie what she does to avoid this mildly awkward interaction. She responded by saying that she “changed her hairstyle and started working out so nobody from that [expletive] high school would recognise her.”
For many, Leslie and Sarah’s story is inspiring, representing the hope that your high school days can be quickly forgotten.
