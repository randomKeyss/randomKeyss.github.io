Socially Conscious Sophomore a Bit Concerned About Barn Dances


Bella, a socially conscious sophomore, attended a barn dance with Outdoor Adventure Club last weekend. She reportedly had some reservations about barn dances representing a form of cultural appropriation, in which students, typically from suburban backgrounds, come to a barn to “cosplay as country-folk for the night.” Bella objected mildly to the premise of a barn dance, noting “a mishmash of country paraphernalia such as flannels, cowboy hats, denim jeans with white t-shirts, and authentic Missourian meth certainly feels very similar to dressing up as another culture for Halloween. That’s gotta be sort of wrong.”
Despite her lukewarm rebukes against widespread cultural appropriation, Bella still went to last weekend’s barn dance and enjoyed herself. “I’m not going to lie, I had a good time. When the farmer took us for a hay ride it was so fun. I just wish I could look at my reflection without feeling guilty.”
Other students, hearing of Bella’s predicament, resolved not to think about it too hard.
