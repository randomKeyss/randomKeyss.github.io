    <H2>Local Squirrel Bored by People-Watching Club</H2>
    <h5> </h5>
    <p>Earlier today, we interviewed Alvin, a local squirrel who is very tired of people calling him a chipmunk. He is a junior currently studying Anatomy, or as the University calls it, “Animal Sciences”. When he is not studying, Alvin loves to hang out with his squirrel friends.
<br><br>
This semester, Alvin, like many other students, wanted to participate in RSO’s (Registered Squirrel Organizations) to be more involved with campus life. According to him “I loved the people-watching club in high school, but in college I just haven’t gotten around to going to club meetings. Yesterday, I decided to change that.”
<br><br>
Resolved to be more involved, Alvin went to a club meeting only to find that “people-watching just isn’t the same on campus. Why do the people around here just sit around on their computers all day?”
<br><br>
In a heartfelt plea, Alvin ended the interview by asking us to publish his story with the hope that the people will read it and go outside more. If not for yourselves, do it for Alvin.</p>
