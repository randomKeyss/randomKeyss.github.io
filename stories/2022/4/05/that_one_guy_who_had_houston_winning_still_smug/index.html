    <H2>That Guy in Your Bracket Pool Who Had Houston Winning It All Still Very Smug</H2>
    <h5>April 5, 2022 </h5>
    <p>This Saturday, Villanova beat Houston in a 50-44 game, knocking the Cougars out of March Madness. In this dominating performance, the Wildcats played solidly and kept their lead throughout the whole game. Yesterday, Kansas won the whole tournament.
<br><br>
Despite this, Craig, the winner of your March Madness bracket pool, remains very smug that he predicted Houston would go to the end, exclaiming, “I knew from the beginning Houston had potential.”
<br><br>
Reportedly, Craig has been saying the following to anyone who would listen: “A lot of my fellow students were upset with me when they saw I predicted Illinois would lose in the second round against Houston. I think if they wanted to win the bracket pool, they shouldn’t have looked at our school's chances with rose-tinted glasses. That’s all I’m saying.”
<br><br>
Some other students have described Craig as “a jerk” and “the guy with the least school spirit in our pool,” but Craig maintains that he “was just being realistic.”</p>
