Cool Professor Excited to Hop on the Gravy Train


Barry Lawrence, a 72 year old tenured professor of sociology, unpromptedly announced in his class today that he is ready to hop on the “Gravy train.” When questioned by an inquisitive student, Lawrence elaborated that as a professor of sociology, he is obliged to keep up with the times, so he will be attending Yung Gravy’s April 24th concert on the quad. The concert is free to all students with I-Cards, but it is unclear if Professor Lawrence will be allowed to watch the concert.
Furthermore, attendees are not allowed to bring any bags to the concert, but they are encouraged to bring a clear water bottle. Professor Lawrence reportedly plans on bringing a water bottle full of gravy to express his enthusiasm for the yung artist.
When we asked the professor if he had ever heard any of Yung Gravy’s songs, he hesitated for a moment before quietly responding, “No.” Professor Lawrence’s students are reportedly simultaneously excited and nervous to see his reaction to Yung Gravy’s music.
