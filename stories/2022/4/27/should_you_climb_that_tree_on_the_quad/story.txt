Should You Climb That Tree on the Quad? An Expert Weighs In


Nothing brings out my inner child better than climbable trees. Their boughs transport me to a more carefree time when Canvas was still something you painted on. Yet when it comes time to grab the bark, I always catch myself. Surely it wouldn’t be acceptable for me to just climb a tree in front of everyone like that. Right?
To be sure, I spoke with our resident expert on tree climbing: Ash Oakbirch. “When considering a possible action, you always have to weigh its costs and benefits,” Ash shouted to me. "The benefit of climbing a tree is obvious. The cost is less so," he yelled from atop a dope looking tree.
Ash further noted that “if you’re walking with someone you want to impress, it’s ideal to pick a climbable but scary tree that you have done many times before. If you are just with friends, then feel free to pick whatever tree fits your fancy.”
Since talking to Ash, I have taken his lessons to heart. To all the haters, I’ll be looking down at you from the best seat on the Quad.
