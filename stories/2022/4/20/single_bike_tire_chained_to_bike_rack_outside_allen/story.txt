“Heartbreaking”: A Single Bike Tire Chained to a Bike Rack Outside Allen Hall


As springtime returns to campus, the birds return along with it, and so too does the Illinois’ large bike population. On a nice afternoon, one can see bikes joyfully taking to the streets with their owners in tow, without a care in the world. Then, when they reach their destination, they rest up and socialize with other bikes at the University’s world class bike racks.
However, if you venture to the bad side of Allen Hall, you will see a sight that speaks of terrible horrors: a single bike wheel chained to a bike rack. One can only imagine what kinds of circumstances that led to this atrocity.
Let this be a lesson to all good bike owners that care for their loving vehicle. A bike lock should secure both the frame and the wheels. Please good citizens, spare a thought for your poor bike before you leave it alone, afraid, and undefended.
