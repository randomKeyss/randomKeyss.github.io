Spike in Inflation for the Dining Dollar Presents Mounting Challenges for the Jones Administration


As students awoke this morning, the Ikenberry Commons Index was at a 22-semester low of 40 corn kernels per dining dollar. This drop follows a lower-than-usual yield from the Morrow Plots, which has called into question the efficacy of the Jones Administration.
Although everyone may have noticed a rise in week-to-week expenses, some students have been hit harder than others. A report from the University Bursar SMMC stated that over 20% of students have been unable to afford all of their basic necessities.
“I used to be able to go to 57 North and get a $1 pretzel with free cheese sauce every day after smoking a bowl,” reported one Snyder Hall resident. “But now I can’t even buy 6 bags of Trolli sour gummy worms without using my parents’ credit card.”
Chancellor Jones in his “State of the Campus” speech last week addressed student concerns about rising prices. 
“Financial crisis has struck across the globe, but our reserves of Illini Cash continue to stand strong against more volatile currencies like BoilerBucks or the US Dollar.” 
It’s yet to be seen if Jones will be able to weather the storm and increase confidence in the campus currency.
