    <H2>Spike in Inflation for the Dining Dollar Presents Mounting Challenges for the Jones Administration</H2>
    <h5>April 26, 2022 </h5>
    <p>As students awoke this morning, the Ikenberry Commons Index was at a 22-semester low of 40 corn kernels per dining dollar. This drop follows a lower-than-usual yield from the Morrow Plots, which has called into question the efficacy of the Jones Administration.
<br><br>
Although everyone may have noticed a rise in week-to-week expenses, some students have been hit harder than others. A report from the University Bursar SMMC stated that over 20% of students have been unable to afford all of their basic necessities.
<br><br>
“I used to be able to go to 57 North and get a $1 pretzel with free cheese sauce every day after smoking a bowl,” reported one Snyder Hall resident. “But now I can’t even buy 6 bags of Trolli sour gummy worms without using my parents’ credit card.”
<br><br>
Chancellor Jones in his “State of the Campus” speech last week addressed student concerns about rising prices. 
<br><br>
“Financial crisis has struck across the globe, but our reserves of Illini Cash continue to stand strong against more volatile currencies like BoilerBucks or the US Dollar.” 
<br><br>
It’s yet to be seen if Jones will be able to weather the storm and increase confidence in the campus currency.</p>
