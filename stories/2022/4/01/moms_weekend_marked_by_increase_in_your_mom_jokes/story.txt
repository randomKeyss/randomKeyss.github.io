Mom’s Weekend Marked by 3000% Increase in "Your Mom" Jokes on Campus


The University’s most awkward annual tradition, Mom’s Weekend, is happening from April 1st-3rd. Our correspondents on the scene report that "your mom" jokes have increased by 3000% on a week over week basis. 
We interviewed a freshman student, Alex on the quad. "I asked the guys ‘What are we doing tonight?’ and they said ‘your mom’. Like come on. That’s not even funny."
We also spoke with Peter, a sophomore, who recounted his experience with Mom’s Weekend: "My mother wants to take my friends out to dinner so she can meet them. The only problem is that whoever I mention it to immediately starts talking about how they ‘can’t wait to go out with my mother’. Jesus. We aren’t 10 anymore guys."
Our correspondents noted that they would’ve had time to interview more people for this story if they didn’t have plans with my mom tonight.
