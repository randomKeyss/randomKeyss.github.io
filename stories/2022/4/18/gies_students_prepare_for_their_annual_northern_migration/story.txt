Gies Students Prepare for Their Annual Northern Migration as Temperatures Increase


As spring eventually, hopefully – maybe – comes around this year, students and townies alike are advised to keep their eyes to the sky. Lucky watchers will hopefully get to see Gies College of Business students take flight on the last part of their northern migration. Finally crossing the Great Lakes, the students can make it back to their breeding grounds of Canada for the summer.
Until then, the Gies students remain on campus, resting up for the grueling last leg of their annual journey. Head fellow of the school of ornithology, Dr. Argrågås recommends that students should conduct their business as usual. “The hissing is normal and shouldn’t be taken personally. [They] are quite pent up from the longer than usual winter,” he says. Pedestrians have raised complaints about how the herds of business students block off sidewalks, building entrances, and sometimes even road traffic, but Argrågås gives his guarantee that the Gies are all honk and no bite.
