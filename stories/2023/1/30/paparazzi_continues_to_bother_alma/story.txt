Paparazzi Continue To Bother Alma


The Alma statue has a storied history as a campus landmark, standing tall on campus for nearly a hundred years. From where it currently resides in front of Altgeld Hall, it welcomes visitors to the campus from near and far, earning it no small measure of fame.
However, this fame comes at a steep cost. Paparazzi and various gawkers harass the statue with pictures and selfies at almost all hours of the day. Without any respite, Alma is forced to continuously pose in place for days, or even months at a time. To make matters worse, rumors on campus abound of a 24 hour camera fixed on Alma, continuously broadcasting any tiny action to the whole world. This intense scrutiny represents a brutal invasion of privacy, and we should take some time to remember that, despite its fame, Alma is just another 10,000 pound bronze statue, no different from you and me.
The Nightly Illini was unable to reach Alma for comment before publication. However, we remain certain that the statue would object, if it weren't being silenced by the university, who allegedly sponsors such invasions of privacy.
