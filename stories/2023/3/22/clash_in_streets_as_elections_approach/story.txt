Clashes in the Streets as Student Elections Approach


Another bloody brawl ensued outside the Union as Anarcho-McGuire-Koscielskists faced off Gajjela Restorationist counter protesters ahead of the upcoming student elections. Seemingly matching the division of our nation, so too is the student body deeply entrenched in political upheaval. After the scandal of the last regime, culminating in a so-called “special election” that many still see as illegitimate, all eyes are on the Orange and Blue House for who will now head our campus.
“ISG is expecting a record turnout, maybe even double digits,” said one election official, “the stakes couldn’t be higher.” Chambana Police is also gearing up, stockpiling riot gear and training officers to handle the impending mob. The chief had this to say: “We will maintain law and order, but there’s no telling what will happen once Kam’s cover reaches $20.”
Air temperature is rising just like the political climate and there’s no telling what could happen next.
