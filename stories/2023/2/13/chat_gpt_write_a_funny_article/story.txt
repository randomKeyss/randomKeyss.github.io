"ChatGPT, write me a funny UIUC themed article"


<i>Attention all UIUC students: it's time to face the cold, hard truth. No, not the fact that winter has arrived and it's only going to get colder. I'm talking about something much more important - the fact that we all know at least one person who wears Illini gear every single day. You know who I'm talking about - that one guy who rocks the orange and blue from head to toe, no matter what the occasion.</i>
<i>Now, don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with showing your school spirit. But sometimes, it can get a little out of hand. I mean, have you ever seen someone wearing an Illini hoodie, an Illini hat, and Illini sweatpants all at the same time? It's like they're trying to tell the world, "Yes, I go to UIUC. Yes, I bleed orange and blue. And yes, I own way too much Illini gear."</i>
Now, "Nightly Illini," you ask, "Isn't copy pasting from ChatGPT both pointless and soulless? Why even bother publishing if anybody can get the same result from a simple eight word prompt?"
Blah, blah, blah, some canned GPT response about how GPT is different from copying and pasting I don't care about, and I couldn't even be bothered to feed your prompt back into the machine, or finish this article. Editor, send this article back into chatGPT and make it funny instead being the echo of my last fucks to give escaping my body.
