    <H2>Socially Conscious Sophomore a Bit Concerned About Barn Dances</H2>
    <h5> </h5>
    <p>Bella, a socially conscious sophomore, attended a barn dance with Outdoor Adventure Club last weekend. She reportedly had some reservations about barn dances representing a form of cultural appropriation, in which students, typically from suburban backgrounds, come to a barn to “cosplay as country-folk for the night.” Bella objected mildly to the premise of a barn dance, noting “a mishmash of country paraphernalia such as flannels, cowboy hats, denim jeans with white t-shirts, and authentic Missourian meth certainly feels very similar to dressing up as another culture for Halloween. That’s gotta be sort of wrong.”
<br><br>
Despite her lukewarm rebukes against widespread cultural appropriation, Bella still went to last weekend’s barn dance and enjoyed herself. “I’m not going to lie, I had a good time. When the farmer took us for a hay ride it was so fun. I just wish I could look at my reflection without feeling guilty.”
<br><br>
Other students, hearing of Bella’s predicament, resolved not to think about it too hard.</p>
