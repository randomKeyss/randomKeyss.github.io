    <H2>Mom’s Weekend Marked by 3000% Increase in "Your Mom" Jokes on Campus
</H2>
    <p>The University’s most awkward annual tradition, Mom’s Weekend, is happening from April 1st-3rd. Our correspondents on the scene report that "your mom" jokes have increased by 3000% on a week over week basis. 
<br><br>
We interviewed a freshman student, Alex on the quad, "I asked the guys ‘What are we doing tonight?’ and they said ‘your mom’. Like come on. That’s not even funny."
<br><br>
We also spoke with Peter, a sophomore, who recounted his experience with Mom’s Weekend: "My mother wants to take my friends out to dinner so she can meet them. The only problem is that whoever I mention it to immediately starts talking about how they ‘can’t wait to go out with my mother’. Jeezus. We aren’t 10 anymore guys."
<br><br>
Our correspondents noted that they would’ve had time to interview more people for this story if they didn’t have plans with my mom tonight.
