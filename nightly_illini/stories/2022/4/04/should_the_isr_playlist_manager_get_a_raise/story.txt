Opinion: Should The ISR Dining Hall Playlist Manager Be Given a "Fat Raise"?


ISR is considered by many to be the nicest dorm in the University. It only takes a glance at the décor to tell it’s expensive, and it only takes a glance at the students to tell they’re all engineers. But venture beyond the lobby with the tastefully placed couches, and you will hear a debate raging over the sound of “Gangsta’s Paradise”. A single question rings loudly: does the playlist manager deserve a fat raise, or to be discharged dishonorably?
We interviewed some students on the scene, and over the sound of “Cotton Eye Joe”, Susanne disgustedly said, "Play a radio station or something. If you want to listen to your motley playlist of nostalgic but obnoxious hits, put in headphones. Why do we have to be subjected to this?"
We also asked Carl, a freshman mechanical engineering major, whether ISR’s playlist manager is doing a good job. With “Life is a Highway” playing in the background, Carl simply retorted: "The music sorta slaps. Give that man a fat raise."
