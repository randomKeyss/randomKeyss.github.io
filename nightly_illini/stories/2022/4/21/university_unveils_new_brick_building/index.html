    <H2>University Unveils New Brick Building</H2>
    <h5> </h5>
    <p>Earlier today, the University unveiled their newest addition to campus: the Clay Material Science Building. In a very predictable twist, the building was made completely out of reddish-brown brick. One student commented that “this new building fits in really well with our style,” while pointing to the wrong building. Another student walked straight past the building, asking our correspondent, “Where is the new building?”

The construction of the Clay Material Science Building cost the University around $50 million, $3 million of which was earmarked for commissioning the architectural design of the building. However, John, a junior majoring in Architectural Studies, says that he could just have easily copied and pasted the design of the neighboring building and he would only charge $5.
<br><br>
University faculty are reportedly very excited to begin experiments at the new labs housed within the Clay Material Science Building. Some have even speculated that with all the extra space in this generically textured building, researchers might discover a new building material.</p>
