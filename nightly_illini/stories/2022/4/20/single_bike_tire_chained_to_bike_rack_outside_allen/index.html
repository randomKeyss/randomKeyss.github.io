    <H2>“Heartbreaking”: A Single Bike Tire Chained to a Bike Rack Outside Allen Hall</H2>
    <h5> </h5>
    <p>As springtime returns to campus, the birds return along with it, and so too does the Illinois’ large bike population. On a nice afternoon, one can see bikes joyfully taking to the streets with their owners in tow, without a care in the world. Then, when they reach their destination, they rest up and socialize with other bikes at the University’s world class bike racks.

<br><br>
However, if you venture to the bad side of Allen Hall, you will see a sight that speaks of terrible horrors: a single bike wheel chained to a bike rack. One can only imagine what kinds of circumstances that led to this atrocity.
<br><br>
Let this be a lesson to all good bike owners that care for their loving vehicle. A bike lock should secure both the frame and the wheels. Please good citizens, spare a thought for your poor bike before you leave it alone, afraid, and undefended.</p>
