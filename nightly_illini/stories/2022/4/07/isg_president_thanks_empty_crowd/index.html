    <H2>Freshman Can’t Wait to Turn 19 so he can Soberly Stand in Champaign Bars</H2>
        <p>In Champaign, bars only allow entry to people 19 or older during bar hours. However, people under the age of 21 in Illinois are not legally allowed to buy or possess alcohol. Thus, while 19 and 20 year olds can legally enter bars, if they do, they have to stand around soberly. To an outside observer, this prospect seems pretty dull.
            <br><br>
            It isn’t dull to Michael, who will turn 19 on April 10th. “I just can't wait to go to Joe’s and stand in a non-intoxicated manner! I’ll have so much fun dancing and talking, all without drinking. Then, at maybe 1:00 or 2:00 I’ll leave and go to Fat Sandwich while being sober as a judge,” said the soon to be 19-year old.
            <br><br>
            While Michael’s enthusiasm may be perplexing, even more perplexing is the prevalence of his attitude. Several other students claimed to want to go to bars, despite being below the legal age of consumption of alcohol.

            Our reporters are excellent at detective work, but some mysteries are too difficult to unravel. Perhaps this is a case of group insanity, or perhaps there is something deeper at play. Only time will tell.
