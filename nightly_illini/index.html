                <p class="blog-post-meta">April 24, 2022 </p>
                <p>Earlier today, we interviewed Alvin, a local squirrel who is very tired of people calling him a chipmunk. He is a junior currently studying Anatomy, or as the University calls it, “Animal Sciences”. When he is not studying, Alvin loves to hang out with his squirrel friends.
<br><br>
This semester, Alvin, like many other students, wanted to participate in RSO’s (Registered Squirrel Organizations) to be more involved with campus life. According to him “I loved the people-watching club in high school, but in college I just haven’t gotten around to going to club meetings. Yesterday, I decided to change that.”
<br><br>
Resolved to be more involved, Alvin went to a club meeting only to find that “people-watching just isn’t the same on campus. Why do the people around here just sit around on their computers all day?”
<br><br>
In a heartfelt plea, Alvin ended the interview by asking us to publish his story with the hope that the people will read it and go outside more. If not for yourselves, do it for Alvin.</p>

            Bella, a socially conscious sophomore, attended a barn dance with Outdoor Adventure Club last weekend. She reportedly had some reservations about barn dances representing a form of cultural appropriation, in which students, typically from suburban backgrounds, come to a barn to “cosplay as country-folk for the night.” Bella objected mildly to the premise of a barn dance, noting “a mishmash of country paraphernalia such as flannels, cowboy hats, denim jeans with white t-shirts, and authentic Missourian meth certainly feels very similar to dressing up as another culture for Halloween. That’s gotta be sort of wrong.”
<br><br>
Despite her lukewarm rebukes against widespread cultural appropriation, Bella still went to last weekend’s barn dance and enjoyed herself. “I’m not going to lie, I had a good time. When the farmer took us for a hay ride it was so fun. I just wish I could look at my reflection without feeling guilty.”
<br><br>
Other students, hearing of Bella’s predicament, resolved not to think about it too hard.

            Earlier today, the University unveiled their newest addition to campus: the Clay Material Science Building. In a very predictable twist, the building was made completely out of reddish-brown brick. One student commented that “this new building fits in really well with our style,” while pointing to the wrong building. Another student walked straight past the building, asking our correspondent, “Where is the new building?”
<br><br>
The construction of the Clay Material Science Building cost the University around $50 million, $3 million of which was earmarked for commissioning the architectural design of the building. However, John, a junior majoring in Architectural Studies, says that he could just have easily copied and pasted the design of the neighboring building and he would only charge $5.
<br><br>
University faculty are reportedly very excited to begin experiments at the new labs housed within the Clay Material Science Building. Some have even speculated that with all the extra space in this generically textured building, researchers might discover a new building material.

            Barry Lawrence, a 72 year old tenured professor of sociology, unpromptedly announced in his class today that he is ready to hop on the “Gravy train.” When questioned by an inquisitive student, Lawrence elaborated that as a professor of sociology, he is obliged to keep up with the times, so he will be attending Yung Gravy’s April 24th concert on the quad. The concert is free to all students with I-Cards, so it is unclear if Professor Lawrence will be allowed to watch the concert.
<br><br>
Furthermore, attendees are not allowed to bring any bags to the concert, but they are encouraged to bring a clear water bottle. Professor Lawrence reportedly plans on bringing a water bottle full of gravy to express his enthusiasm for the yung artist.
<br><br>
When we asked the professor if he had ever heard any of Yung Gravy’s songs, he hesitated for a moment before quietly responding, “No.” Professor Lawrence’s students are reportedly simultaneously excited and nervous to see his reaction to Yung Gravy’s music.

            On October 5th, 2020, Chancellor Jones signed the Illinois Climate Action Plan, a plan intending to ensure that the University reaches complete carbon neutrality by 2050. Today, students celebrated Earth Day by running widespread demonstrations protesting the University’s push towards a neutral stance on carbon.
<br><br>
One protester named Sarah proclaimed, “Martin Luther King once said, ‘The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.’ The University can not and should not remain neutral on carbon emissions. This policy of carbon neutrality will damn us all!”
<br><br>
The University has not made an official response to the protests, counter-protesters have noted that neutrality worked pretty well for Switzerland in WWII, so it may well work for this climate crisis.

            As springtime returns to campus, the birds return along with it, and so too does the Illinois’ large bike population. On a nice afternoon, one can see bikes joyfully taking to the streets with their owners in tow, without a care in the world. Then, when they reach their destination, they rest up and socialize with other bikes at the University’s world class bike racks.
<br><br>
However, if you venture to the bad side of Allen Hall, you will see a sight that speaks of terrible horrors: a single bike wheel chained to a bike rack. One can only imagine what kinds of circumstances that led to this atrocity.
<br><br>
Let this be a lesson to all good bike owners that care for their loving vehicle. A bike lock should secure both the frame and the wheels. Please good citizens, spare a thought for your poor bike before you leave it alone, afraid, and undefended.

            As spring eventually, hopefully – maybe – comes around this year, students and townies alike are advised to keep their eyes to the sky. Lucky watchers will hopefully get to see Gies College of Business students take flight on the last part of their northern migration. Finally crossing the Great Lakes, the students can make it back to their breeding grounds of Canada for the summer.
<br><br>
Until then, the Gies students remain on campus, resting up for the grueling last leg of their annual journey. Head fellow of the school of ornithology, Dr. Argrågås recommends that students should conduct their business as usual. “The hissing is normal and shouldn’t be taken personally. [They] are quite pent up from the longer than usual winter,” he says. Pedestrians have raised complaints about how the herds of business students block off sidewalks, building entrances, and sometimes even road traffic, but Argrågås gives his guarantee that the Gies are all bark and no bite.
