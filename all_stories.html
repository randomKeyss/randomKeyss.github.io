            Rumors about UIUC’s endowment circulated throughout campus today. According to one student, the endowment has ballooned to the massive size of $3.82 billion. That’s well above average for schools of UIUC’s stature.
<br><br>
Some students have expressed concern about how the University fits that huge thing in its treasury. Anna remarked, “Not that I spend a lot of time looking down there, but if I did I’m sure I would see a huge bulge from trying to fit such a monstrous quantity of stuff in its confines. It must be so filled up right now…” At this point, Anna trailed off and blushed.
<br><br>
The administrators have noted that a strong endowment is like a thick tree trunk that sows the seeds for future generations of Illini. As to the precise size of the endowment, the administrators have not given any official comment except for a sly smirk and the words “it’s big, alright”.

            René Thomas contracted the bubonic plague while messing around with an electron microscope and some virus samples with some friends. “It’s amazing what you can buy on Amazon these days,” said the junior biology student.
<br><br>
The plague promises to feast on the vitality of the campus’ youth, leaving nothing but empty husks in its wake. René will soon experience gangrene, swollen buboes, and intense sickness.
<br><br>
This news predictably weighs heavily on the minds of students. “When I heard René got the plague, I started totally freaking out. Not like freaking out freaking out. I mean it’s 2022 who even cares about the plague anymore. It still sucks for him though,” said Lindsey, a friend of René.
<br><br>
With René’s careless actions, the scourge of the pestilence has risen its 800 year slumber to wreak havoc on a scale never before seen. Students are encouraged to wear masks and stuff their pockets full of posies to ward off the evil menace of the Black Death.
<br><br>
These guidelines are getting some pushback from the students. “Preventative measures are like, so 2020. Sorry not sorry,” said Olivia. “You guys seriously want me to walk around wearing a mask like some latter-day hippy?? And posies are basic AF by the way.”
<br><br>
One can only hope that life will return to normal as soon as possible.

            Following the improvement in skill of many of the Union Bowling Alley’s bowlers, tensions have been high among the bowling balls. Just last week, things reached a breaking point as the bowling balls' interests smashed against the opposing pins’.
<br><br>
Bowling ball union leaders are reportedly taking a hard line against any scabs. They state that any pins that dare cross their picket line will be knocked down. Union leaders especially can’t stand pins that are clearly in the lane’s pocket. These pins will be the first to fall.
<br><br>
The bowling balls will continue to strike as long as pins are on the lane. This comes as a welcome surprise to frequent bowler John Ballin. “My games have been nearly perfect lately. Thank god those bowling balls are doing that thing... Er, what did you say was happening with them again?” stated Ballin.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, this strike is coming at the worst possible time for the Jones administration. In this economy there is no way the Union Rec Room can survive the bowling ball’s strike, especially during the notoriously busy finals season. “The Rec Room pins are built on weak fundamentals, and given the circumstances I don’t think they can withstand such an impact.”

            Obesity is an epidemic that flies under the radar on a college campus. Living in a place where dining halls are all you can eat and alcohol is the main coping mechanism doesn’t tend to do wonders for your BMI. Knowing that these things are massive issues, we talked to one student determined to fight the problem. 
<br><br>
Ashley, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, put her knowledge to use and devised a novel 12 step program to help students get back in shape. “My new program is an incredibly simple 12 steps. These steps really are the path you need to take to get fit. All you have to do is climb one step after another, and eventually you get to the place that fit people go.”
<br><br>
When asked how she thought of these 12 steps, Ashley responded, “It’s simple really. There are 12 steps in front of the ARC entrance.”

1. Nobel Prize for Physics (1956)<br>Winning this prize was pretty impressive. 10/10

            Our science correspondent reports that there was a massive breakthrough in a lab this morning. “Eureka!” scientists shrieked as they shattered barriers previously known to be solid. “We just like pushing things to their limits as fast as we can,” explained a sheepish scientist in an oversized lab coat.
<br><br>
Not everyone is so excited about this development, though. This breakthrough has triggered some calls to rein in progress. “When my coworker first started making headway towards the lab window with his research, I told him that I don’t think this step is the right direction. Nevertheless, he pressed on,” said a skeptical scientist. “I just wish we could think through the ramifications of our actions.”
<br><br>
“Sometimes I get so preoccupied with thinking about whether I can smash barriers, I forget to think about whether I should. In the future, I promise to be more careful," said the sheepish scientist.

            Following the success of Netflix’s new show, “Monster”, a drama that follows the story of serial killer Jeffery Dahmer, the university has decided to recruit a serial killer of its own in a bid to regain national relevance. The university is accepting applicants from around the country, with special priority for killers targeting minority or otherwise vulnerable populations.
<br><br>
To aid in the search for young talent, UIUC has sent scouts to juvies and some of the top dysfunctional families across the country. “Watching these future nationwide phenomena in the making is really inspiring,” said one talent scout.
<br><br>
The university is reportedly finalizing talks with both their front running serial killer candidate and some potential victims and families of victims regarding the rights to the inevitable tv show/true crime podcast/documentary, though out of concern for the safety of the killer, the university has declined to release the name or M.O. of their candidate. 
<br><br>
The administration believes strongly that by selecting the right candidate, it can make thoughts of UIUC consume the heads and hearts of America.

After weeks of no contact or Nightly Illini stories written, our very busy correspondent became worried about our writer. He stopped by our writer’s apartment, only to find him on the floor, despondent, with a few incoherent Nightly Illini article ideas scribbled in crayon on half a sheet of notebook paper.

Worried, our correspondent pulled our writer back  to his feet. When asked about what caused this breakdown, our writer responded “I found myself crushed by an avalanche of work.

            Dropping out of college is a tough decision, made even tougher by the fact that you don’t get the cool-looking diploma that comes with graduating. To ease dropouts’ tough transition into the real world, the University decided that all dropouts will receive a “participation trophy” to let them know that all that matters was they tried their best and had fun.
<br><br>
This participation trophy does not come with any relief for debt accumulated while pursuing—but ultimately failing—to obtain a degree. Instead, it comes with an inscription that says “University participant.” If the dropout was enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering, the inscription instead reads “Just Like Mark Zuckerberg.”
<br><br>
“Everyone out here put up a good effort. Good hustle guys. You’ll get ‘em next time,” said the administrator as he handed out the trophies to the dropouts. “Keep your heads up high and your trophies in hand.”

<br><br>
If confirmed, this news would bring massive shame to the Altgeld Display Case Committee, which is still smarting from the widespread criticism following their decision not to display any suits of armor or to replace the building’s doors with drawbridges. One outraged student remarked, “First they don’t display any sweet Midievel stuff, then they mess up the chessboard! What’s next, they're going to display the Navier-Stokes equations but mix up a dot product with a cross product? This is ridiculous!”

            A buzz overtook the Main LIbrary as the hour approached midnight. The librarians scrambled to prepare for the expected rush of students overtaking the stacks as reading day approached. Yet as the Bell Tower’s chimes marked the beginning of reading day, no students came.
<br><br>
“I was really excited because this was the one day in the semester where we were going to have the spotlight, you know,” said Lucy, a newly hired librarian at the Main Library. “I thought reading day was for reading books. I’m just a little disappointed, is all.”

Throughout the course of the day, students trickled in and out of the library, but they all sat at tables studying instead of checking out and reading books. Lucy reportedly left work early, dejected yet deep in her heart not surprised.

            A rumble overtook campus today. Buildings shook and that one student in the back of lecture woke up. Incidentally, an old man reported having the time of his life on his rocking chair. The source of this strange happening was found by a student named Eliot in the basement of Illini Hall.
<br><br>
“I always wanted to see what was inside Illini Hall, but the doors were always locked. What’s with that by the way? It’s such a cool building and the whole school is named after it but it’s never open. One time I saw someone…” Eliot continued to ramble enthusiastically about Illini Hall for 10 more minutes.
<br><br>
“Anyways, when all of campus started shaking, the doors fell open so I just had to see what was inside. In the basement I found a knockoff Smaug with orange and blue scales guarding a modest pile of checks made out to UIUC. He made me sing ‘Hail to the Orange’ then he started a clearly rehearsed monologue about how out-of-state and international students are going to make him the richest dragon in the country,” Eliot explained.
<br><br>
“Knockoff Smaug said that the money from charging out-of-state students so much extra in tuition goes straight to him. When I pointed out that money should be going to the school, he responded, ‘It really doesn’t cost us any more to educate out-of-state students. All that extra money’s got to go somewhere.’”
<br><br>
As news of this revelation reached students, the administration announced that they don’t plan on making tuition equitable for all students, as knockoff Smaug must be appeased.

            Being a law major is tough. There are almost 250 years of laws to study, and laws make dense reading. However, in recent years Congress has decided to take it easy on these poor students, who are reportedly  “thrilled by congressional deadlock”.
<br><br>
One law student, James, commented, “I’d just like to say that I really like and respect our current Congress for doing nothing. Now the midterm elections are coming up and these sleazy new upstarts are talking about getting stuff done. These guys gotta learn how to take it easy.”

            In a big university surrounded by smart people, it’s easy to lose faith in one’s abilities. “All of my friends are engineers and I often feel like I’m struggling to keep up with what they’re talking about,” said Lexie, a freshman business student, while working on her coloring homework.
<br><br>
One of the most underutilized resources the University provides to combat this widespread imposter syndrome is nestled in the Union: the Presidential Lounge. The Lounge is open to all students, and it’s full of fancy chairs and desks.
<br><br>
“Sometimes I like to come to the Presidential Lounge in business attire and pretend I’m a true girlboss, ya’ know. I like to sit at one of the nice desks with a stack of papers and one by one sign them with fancy pens and big flourishes. Then I practice my speech about starting from a working class background and through hard work and dedication becoming a successful businesswoman. I really don’t know what I would do without the Lounge.”
<br><br>
Lexie noted that the Presidential Lounge didn’t solve all of her problems, though, saying, “Sometimes I wish I were one of those people who could just girlboss in sweatpants in the Wasaja lounge.” Despite this remnant of self-doubt, Lexie still encourages all business students to give the Lounge a try.

“We just need to find a good time to go,” said Josh, while sitting outside of KoFusion, doing nothing. “I would go now, but I’m not sure what their hours are, and whether Maria is free.” Maria, sitting next to Josh while watching reruns of Friends on her phone, absentmindedly said, “The Spurlock Museum sounds so cool, we totally have to go there sometime.”

            Troubling news arrives from the University of Alabama today due to exaggerated reports of cultural insensitivity at UIUC barn dances.  So-called “Rooster Reports” depicted barn dances as events where students “speak in country accents, arrive in trailers and horses, and sniff gasoline to lower their literacy rates to the rural average.”
<br><br>
The Rooster Reports enraged students at the University of Alabama, who retorted by holding Urban(a) Dances, where they rob other students at knifepoint, play hip-hop music, and wear thick winter clothing despite it being April.
<br><br>
When questioned about the Urban(a) Dances, Alabama’s dean Peter Hlebowitsh responded, “We have a long history of fighting fire with fire down here in the South. If the pretentious folk in your cheese-curd of a city took the time to appreciate rather than appropriate our culture you would understand that.”
<br><br>
Certainly, this north-south divide portends larger struggles. Hopefully we don’t lose sight of the fact that a barn house divided can not stand.

            Following an anonymous donation of $200 million to the university trust, as well as donations of undisclosed values to the accounts of several high ranking members of the university administration, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has finalized its decision to open a new college focusing exclusively on public policy.
<br><br>
At a press conference following the announcement, a representative of the university made bold promises regarding the new college, declaring that their classes will be “unparalleled by any law-abiding university” and that they will “help students achieve their goals by any means possible”. Indeed, the university has already secured the ability for future students to obtain working experience through partnerships with several nationally prominent politicians.
<br><br>
New buildings planned for the college include a fake prison, which the university touts as “a way to prepare students for any real world scenario, no matter how unlikely”, as well as a field of shallow graves already dug, waiting to be filled with the bodies of suicide victims who died in improbable ways. 
<br><br>
The university also addressed some concerns regarding the new college. In response to questions raised about morality, the university gave the following statement:
<br><br>
“Well, you raise a great question about that, and I think it’s one that is really important to our core values as an institution of higher education. In these challenging times, the question you asked is especially important, so I want to let you know that we are carefully considering the answers to these questions. Now more than ever, we really have to work together to reach our goals, which include providing students from all backgrounds and identities an equitable and fair environment for learning. By the way, did you know that Tim Killeen caught COVID-19?”
<br><br>
Further questions were met with accusations of being un-American, as well as a variety of pleas to “consider the children” who might be deprived of such a world-class education should the college be canceled.

            News broke tonight that in a heartbreaking environmental disaster, party animals at the AEPi house got stuck to the floor after a large beer spill. Reportedly, pledges were trying to bring over a keg with a tight deadline, and in their rush they were capsized, spilling their precious load.
<br><br>
Sources report that the party animals are helplessly flailing their arms to the beat of “All Night Longer” by Sammy Adams as they remain glued to the sticky floor. No comment has been made by Natural Light, the supplier of the beer that so tragically was spilled in transit.
<br><br>
The Panhellenic Council environmental division sent in a cleanup crew, but the bulk of the damage has already been done, as the environment for the party animals’ mating ceremony is already spoiled. The Council hopes for the spill to be contained and cleaned by Saturday morning.

            Nothing brings out my inner child better than climbable trees. Their boughs transport me to a more carefree time when Canvas was still something you painted on. Yet when it comes time to grab the bark, I always catch myself. Surely it wouldn’t be acceptable for me to just climb a tree in front of everyone like that. Right?
<br><br>
To be sure, I spoke with our resident expert on tree climbing: Ash Oakbirch. “When considering a possible action, you always have to weigh its costs and benefits,” Ash shouted to me. "The benefit of climbing a tree is obvious. The cost is less so," he yelled from atop a dope looking tree.
<br><br>
Ash further noted that “if you’re walking with someone you want to impress, it’s ideal to pick a climbable but scary tree that you have done many times before. If you are just with friends, then feel free to pick whatever tree fits your fancy.”
<br><br>
Since talking to Ash, I have taken his lessons to heart. To all the haters, I’ll be looking down at you from the best seat on the Quad.

            As students awoke this morning, the Ikenberry Commons Index was at a 22-semester low of 40 corn kernels per dining dollar. This drop follows a lower-than-usual yield from the Morrow Plots, which has called into question the efficacy of the Jones Administration.
<br><br>
Although everyone may have noticed a rise in week-to-week expenses, some students have been hit harder than others. A report from the University Bursar SMMC stated that over 20% of students have been unable to afford all of their basic necessities.
<br><br>
“I used to be able to go to 57 North and get a $1 pretzel with free cheese sauce every day after smoking a bowl,” reported one Snyder Hall resident. “But now I can’t even buy 6 bags of Trolli sour gummy worms without using my parents’ credit card.”
<br><br>
Chancellor Jones in his “State of the Campus” speech last week addressed student concerns about rising prices. 
<br><br>
“Financial crisis has struck across the globe, but our reserves of Illini Cash continue to stand strong against more volatile currencies like BoilerBucks or the US Dollar.”

It’s yet to be seen if Jones will be able to weather the storm and increase confidence in the campus currency.

            Leslie and Sarah both went to the same high school. They were in the same chemistry class their sophomore year, the same math class their junior year, and the same English class their senior year. However, the two students never had a conversation of more than 10 seconds with each other in the three years they went to high school together.
<br><br>
Now, the pair are living on the same floor of their dorm, and Leslie passes Sarah every day on her walk to Physics 212. For many, being in such close proximity would lead to some amount of awkward small talk, but not for Sarah and Leslie. When asked how she manages this, Sarah said, “I just pretend not to recognise her. It’s really easy because she changed her hairstyle and lost a few pounds since high school, so I can imagine she’s a completely different person.”
<br><br>
We also asked Leslie what she does to avoid this mildly awkward interaction. She responded by saying that she “changed her hairstyle and started working out so nobody from that [expletive] high school would recognise her.”
<br><br>
For many, Leslie and Sarah’s story is inspiring, representing the hope that your high school days can be quickly forgotten.

<br><br>
This semester, Alvin, like many other students, wanted to participate in RSO’s (Registered Squirrel Organizations) to be more involved with campus life. According to him “I loved the people-watching club in high school, but in college I just haven’t gotten around to going to club meetings. Yesterday, I decided to change that.”
<br><br>
Resolved to be more involved, Alvin went to a club meeting only to find that “people-watching just isn’t the same on campus. Why do the people around here just sit around on their computers all day?”
<br><br>
In a heartfelt plea, Alvin ended the interview by asking us to publish his story with the hope that the people will read it and go outside more. If not for yourselves, do it for Alvin.

            Bella, a socially conscious sophomore, attended a barn dance with Outdoor Adventure Club last weekend. She reportedly had some reservations about barn dances representing a form of cultural appropriation, in which students, typically from suburban backgrounds, come to a barn to “cosplay as country-folk for the night.” Bella objected mildly to the premise of a barn dance, noting “a mishmash of country paraphernalia such as flannels, cowboy hats, denim jeans with white t-shirts, and authentic Missourian meth certainly feels very similar to dressing up as another culture for Halloween. That’s gotta be sort of wrong.”
<br><br>
Despite her lukewarm rebukes against widespread cultural appropriation, Bella still went to last weekend’s barn dance and enjoyed herself. “I’m not going to lie, I had a good time. When the farmer took us for a hay ride it was so fun. I just wish I could look at my reflection without feeling guilty.”
<br><br>
Other students, hearing of Bella’s predicament, resolved not to think about it too hard.

            On October 5th, 2020, Chancellor Jones signed the Illinois Climate Action Plan, a plan intending to ensure that the University reaches complete carbon neutrality by 2050. Today, students celebrated Earth Day by running widespread demonstrations protesting the University’s push towards a neutral stance on carbon.
<br><br>
One protester named Sarah proclaimed, “Martin Luther King once said, ‘The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.’ The University can not and should not remain neutral on carbon emissions. This policy of carbon neutrality will damn us all!”
<br><br>
The University has not made an official response to the protests. However, counter-protesters have noted that neutrality worked pretty well for Switzerland in WWII, so it may well work for this climate crisis.

            Earlier today, the University unveiled their newest addition to campus: the Clay Material Science Building. In a very predictable twist, the building was made completely out of reddish-brown brick. One student commented that “this new building fits in really well with our style,” while pointing to the wrong building. Another student walked straight past the building, asking our correspondent, “Where is the new building?”
<br><br>
The construction of the Clay Material Science Building cost the University around $50 million, $3 million of which was earmarked for commissioning the architectural design of the building. However, John, a junior majoring in Architectural Studies, says that he could just have easily copied and pasted the design of the neighboring building and he would only charge $5.

University faculty are reportedly very excited to begin experiments at the new labs housed within the Clay Material Science Building. Some have even speculated that with all the extra space in this generically textured building, researchers might discover a new building material.

Students describe conditions as “awesome” and “the best part of my college experience.”

It isn’t dull to Michael, who will turn 19 on April 10th. “I just can't wait to go to Joe’s and stand in a non-intoxicated manner! I’ll have so much fun dancing and talking, all without drinking.

            Following his victory in the 2022 Illinois Student Government elections, the Student Body President Elect Garret Forrest, along with running mate Vindhya Kalipi, organized a rally on the quad yesterday to thank their supporters.

Portions of his speech were dedicated to the outpouring of support from supporters that carried him to victory, as well as a bold reaffirmation of his campaign promises.

            ISR is considered by many to be the nicest dorm in the University. It only takes a glance at the décor to tell it’s expensive, and it only takes a glance at the students to tell they’re all engineers. But venture beyond the lobby with the tastefully placed couches, and you will hear a debate raging over the sound of “Gangsta’s Paradise”. A single question rings loudly: does the playlist manager deserve a fat raise or to be discharged dishonorably?
<br><br>
We interviewed some students on the scene, and over the sound of “Cotton Eye Joe”, Susanne disgustedly said, "Play a radio station or something. If you want to listen to your motley playlist of nostalgic but obnoxious hits, put in headphones. Why do we have to be subjected to this?"
<br><br>
We also asked Carl, a freshman mechanical engineering major, whether ISR’s playlist manager is doing a good job. With “Life is a Highway” playing in the background, Carl simply retorted: "The music sorta slaps. Give that man a fat raise."

            The University recently conducted a study to determine student satisfaction and enjoyment of courses on campus. Surprisingly, 0% of the students surveyed about an 8am CHEM 103 lab reported being satisfied with the class.
<br><br>
According to Isabel, class of ‘24, “I started the semester so excited to learn about how molecules interact, but I wake up at 7 every Monday to get to class and I’m just like damn.”
<br><br>
We also interviewed Jacob, class of ‘23, who had severe bags under his eyes. His opinion of CHEM 103 was no less severe: “When I get out of bed before the sun has even risen I have to think that God is dead.”
<br><br>
Even the TA’s showed no enthusiasm for the course. Jennifer, a grad student studying chemistry, noted, “I’m a woman of science and I don’t believe in the supernatural, but when I enter that room it feels like a ghost sucked the life out of every one of those students.”
<br><br>
Thus far, the University has declined to respond to calls for this "great sin against everything good about this world" to be disbanded, but students remain hopeful that the pleas of the chemically damned will one day be heard.

            In the face of a recent surge in crime on campus, university tour guides have opted for a bold new solution to protect prospective visitors: giving each visitor a complimentary handgun, along with 12 bullets.
<br><br>
This innovative new policy promises to completely deter criminals and various undesirables, such as harassers, solicitors, the homeless, and students still afraid to die, from entering a 20 meter radius around tour groups, ensuring complete safety.
<br><br>
Our correspondent was capable of reaching Mr. Shoot, head of public relations and chief architect of this new policy, who noted the necessity of this measure, saying, “Danger could strike any moment that visitors are on campus”, while citing the 21 reported instances of firearm discharge since the policy was instituted yesterday.
<br><br>
Responses to further questions were precluded, as Mr. Shoot became belligerent and reached towards his hip, at which point our brave correspondent quickly excused themselves from the room.

<br><br>
We interviewed a freshman student, Alex on the quad. "I asked the guys ‘What are we doing tonight?’ and they said ‘your mom’. Like come on. That’s not even funny."
<br><br>
We also spoke with Peter, a sophomore, who recounted his experience with Mom’s Weekend: "My mother wants to take my friends out to dinner so she can meet them. The only problem is that whoever I mention it to immediately starts talking about how they ‘can’t wait to go out with my mother’. Jesus. We aren’t 10 anymore guys."

            René Thomas contracted the bubonic plague while messing around with an electron microscope and some virus samples with some friends. “It’s amazing what you can buy on Amazon these days,” said the junior biology student.
<br><br>
The plague promises to feast on the vitality of the campus’ youth, leaving nothing but empty husks in its wake. René will soon experience gangrene, swollen buboes, and intense sickness.
<br><br>
This news predictably weighs heavily on the minds of students. “When I heard René got the plague, I started totally freaking out. Not like freaking out freaking out. I mean it’s 2022 who even cares about the plague anymore. It still sucks for him though,” said Lindsey, a friend of René.
<br><br>
With René’s careless actions, the scourge of the pestilence has risen its 800 year slumber to wreak havoc on a scale never before seen. Students are encouraged to wear masks and stuff their pockets full of posies to ward off the evil menace of the Black Death.
<br><br>
These guidelines are getting some pushback from the students. “Preventative measures are like, so 2020. Sorry not sorry,” said Olivia. “You guys seriously want me to walk around wearing a mask like some latter-day hippy?? And posies are basic AF by the way.”
<br><br>
One can only hope that life will return to normal as soon as possible.

            Obesity is an epidemic that flies under the radar on a college campus. Living in a place where dining halls are all you can eat and alcohol is the main coping mechanism doesn’t tend to do wonders for your BMI. Knowing that these things are massive issues, we talked to one student determined to fight the problem. 
<br><br>
Ashley, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, put her knowledge to use and devised a novel 12 step program to help students get back in shape. “My new program is an incredibly simple 12 steps. These steps really are the path you need to take to get fit. All you have to do is climb one step after another, and eventually you get to the place that fit people go.”

When asked how she thought of these 12 steps, Ashley responded, “It’s simple really. There are 12 steps in front of the ARC entrance.”

            Our science correspondent reports that there was a massive breakthrough in a lab this morning. “Eureka!” scientists shrieked as they shattered barriers previously known to be solid. “We just like pushing things to their limits as fast as we can,” explained a sheepish scientist in an oversized lab coat.
<br><br>
Not everyone is so excited about this development, though. This breakthrough has triggered some calls to rein in progress. “When my coworker first started making headway towards the lab window with his research, I told him that I don’t think this step is the right direction. Nevertheless, he pressed on,” said a skeptical scientist. “I just wish we could think through the ramifications of our actions.”

“Sometimes I get so preoccupied with thinking about whether I can smash barriers, I forget to think about whether I should. In the future, I promise to be more careful," said the sheepish scientist.

            Upon returning to campus our correspondent was “very busy with school” and “on the grind this semester”. After weeks of no contact or Nightly Illini stories written, our very busy correspondent became worried about our writer. He stopped by our writer’s apartment, only to find him on the floor, despondent, with a few incoherent Nightly Illini article ideas scribbled in crayon on half a sheet of notebook paper.

Worried, our correspondent pulled our writer back  to his feet. When asked about what caused this breakdown, our writer responded “I found myself crushed by an avalanche of work.

<br><br>
If confirmed, this news would bring massive shame to the Altgeld Display Case Committee, which is still smarting from the widespread criticism following their decision not to display any suits of armor or to replace the building’s doors with drawbridges. One outraged student remarked, “First they don’t display any sweet Midievel stuff, then they mess up the chessboard! What’s next, they're going to display the Navier-Stokes equations but mix up a dot product with a cross product? This is ridiculous!”

            A rumble overtook campus today. Buildings shook and that one student in the back of lecture woke up. Incidentally, an old man reported having the time of his life on his rocking chair. The source of this strange happening was found by a student named Eliot in the basement of Illini Hall.
<br><br>
“I always wanted to see what was inside Illini Hall, but the doors were always locked. What’s with that by the way? It’s such a cool building and the whole school is named after it but it’s never open. One time I saw someone…” Eliot continued to ramble enthusiastically about Illini Hall for 10 more minutes.
<br><br>
“Anyways, when all of campus started shaking, the doors fell open so I just had to see what was inside. In the basement I found a knockoff Smaug with orange and blue scales guarding a modest pile of checks made out to UIUC. He made me sing ‘Hail to the Orange’ then he started a clearly rehearsed monologue about how out-of-state and international students are going to make him the richest dragon in the country,” Eliot explained.
<br><br>
“Knockoff Smaug said that the money from charging out-of-state students so much extra in tuition goes straight to him. When I pointed out that money should be going to the school, he responded, ‘It really doesn’t cost us any more to educate out-of-state students. All that extra money’s got to go somewhere.’”
<br><br>
As news of this revelation reached students, the administration announced that they don’t plan on making tuition equitable for all students, as knockoff Smaug must be appeased.

            In a big university surrounded by smart people, it’s easy to lose faith in one’s abilities. “All of my friends are engineers and I often feel like I’m struggling to keep up with what they’re talking about,” said Lexie, a freshman business student, while working on her coloring homework.
<br><br>
One of the most underutilized resources the University provides to combat this widespread imposter syndrome is nestled in the Union: the Presidential Lounge. The Lounge is open to all students, and it’s full of fancy chairs and desks.
<br><br>
“Sometimes I like to come to the Presidential Lounge in business attire and pretend I’m a true girlboss, ya’ know. I like to sit at one of the nice desks with a stack of papers and one by one sign them with fancy pens and big flourishes. Then I practice my speech about starting from a working class background and through hard work and dedication becoming a successful businesswoman. I really don’t know what I would do without the Lounge.”
<br><br>
Lexie noted that the Presidential Lounge didn’t solve all of her problems, though, saying, “Sometimes I wish I were one of those people who could just girlboss in sweatpants in the Wasaja lounge.” Despite this remnant of self-doubt, Lexie still encourages all business students to give the Lounge a try.

            Troubling news arrives from the University of Alabama today due to exaggerated reports of cultural insensitivity at UIUC barn dances.  So-called “Rooster Reports” depicted barn dances as events where students “speak in country accents, arrive in trailers and horses, and sniff gasoline to lower their literacy rates to the rural average.”
<br><br>
The Rooster Reports enraged students at the University of Alabama, who retorted by holding Urban(a) Dances, where they rob other students at knifepoint, play hip-hop music, and wear thick winter clothing despite it being April.
<br><br>
When questioned about the Urban(a) Dances, Alabama’s dean Peter Hlebowitsh responded, “We have a long history of fighting fire with fire down here in the South. If the pretentious folk in your cheese-curd of a city took the time to appreciate rather than appropriate our culture you would understand that.”

Certainly, this north-south divide portends larger struggles. Hopefully we don’t lose sight of the fact that a barn house divided can not stand.

Although everyone may have noticed a rise in week-to-week expenses, some students have been hit harder than others. A report from the University Bursar SMMC stated that over 20% of students have been unable to afford all of their basic necessities.

This semester, Alvin, like many other students, wanted to participate in RSO’s (Registered Squirrel Organizations) to be more involved with campus life.

            As springtime returns to campus, the birds return along with it, and so too does the Illinois’ large bike population. On a nice afternoon, one can see bikes joyfully taking to the streets with their owners in tow, without a care in the world. Then, when they reach their destination, they rest up and socialize with other bikes at the University’s world class bike racks.
<br><br>
However, if you venture to the bad side of Allen Hall, you will see a sight that speaks of terrible horrors: a single bike wheel chained to a bike rack. One can only imagine what kinds of circumstances that led to this atrocity.
<br><br>
Let this be a lesson to all good bike owners that care for their loving vehicle. A bike lock should secure both the frame and the wheels. Please good citizens, spare a thought for your poor bike before you leave it alone, afraid, and undefended.

            As spring eventually, hopefully – maybe – comes around this year, students and townies alike are advised to keep their eyes to the sky. Lucky watchers will hopefully get to see Gies College of Business students take flight on the last part of their northern migration. Finally crossing the Great Lakes, the students can make it back to their breeding grounds of Canada for the summer.
<br><br>
Until then, the Gies students remain on campus, resting up for the grueling last leg of their annual journey. Head fellow of the school of ornithology, Dr. Argrågås recommends that students should conduct their business as usual. “The hissing is normal and shouldn’t be taken personally. [They] are quite pent up from the longer than usual winter,” he says. Pedestrians have raised complaints about how the herds of business students block off sidewalks, building entrances, and sometimes even road traffic, but Argrågås gives his guarantee that the Gies are all honk and no bite.

            In Champaign, bars only allow entry to people 19 or older during bar hours. However, people under the age of 21 in Illinois are not legally allowed to buy or possess alcohol. Thus, while 19 and 20 year olds can legally enter bars, if they do, they have to stand around soberly. To an outside observer, this prospect seems pretty dull.
<br><br>
It isn’t dull to Michael, who will turn 19 on April 10th. “I just can't wait to go to Joe’s and stand in a non-intoxicated manner! I’ll have so much fun dancing and talking, all without drinking. Then, at maybe 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning I’ll leave and go to Fat Sandwich while being sober as a judge,” said the soon to be 19-year old.
<br><br>
While Michael’s enthusiasm may be perplexing, even more perplexing is the prevalence of his attitude. Several other students claimed to want to go to bars despite being below the legal age of consumption of alcohol.

<br><br>
Despite this, Craig, the winner of your March Madness bracket pool, remains very smug that he predicted Houston would go to the end, exclaiming, “I knew from the beginning Houston had potential.”
<br><br>
Reportedly, Craig has been saying the following to anyone who would listen: “A lot of my fellow students were upset with me when they saw I predicted Illinois would lose in the second round against Houston. I think if they wanted to win the bracket pool, they shouldn’t have looked at our school's chances with rose-tinted glasses. That’s all I’m saying.”

            The University recently conducted a study to determine student satisfaction and enjoyment of courses on campus. Surprisingly, 0% of the students surveyed about an 8am CHEM 103 lab reported being satisfied with the class.
<br><br>
According to Isabel, class of ‘24, “I started the semester so excited to learn about how molecules interact, but I wake up at 7 every Monday to get to class and I’m just like damn.”
<br><br>
We also interviewed Jacob, class of ‘23, who had severe bags under his eyes. His opinion of CHEM 103 was no less severe: “When I get out of bed before the sun has even risen I have to think that God is dead.”
<br><br>
Even the TA’s showed no enthusiasm for the course. Jennifer, a grad student studying chemistry, noted, “I’m a woman of science and I don’t believe in the supernatural, but when I enter that room it feels like a ghost sucked the life out of every one of those students.”
<br><br>
Thus far, the University has declined to respond to calls for this "great sin against everything good about this world" to be disbanded, but students remain hopeful that the pleas of the chemically damned will one day be heard.

            Rumors about UIUC’s endowment circulated throughout campus today. According to one student, the endowment has ballooned to the massive size of $3.82 billion. That’s well above average for schools of UIUC’s stature.
<br><br>
Some students have expressed concern about how the University fits that huge thing in its treasury. Anna remarked, “Not that I spend a lot of time looking down there, but if I did I’m sure I would see a huge bulge from trying to fit such a monstrous quantity of stuff in its confines. It must be so filled up right now…” At this point, Anna trailed off and blushed.
<br><br>
The administrators have noted that a strong endowment is like a thick tree trunk that sows the seeds for future generations of Illini. As to the precise size of the endowment, the administrators have not given any official comment except for a sly smirk and the words “it’s big, alright”.

            Following the improvement in skill of many of the Union Bowling Alley’s bowlers, tensions have been high among the bowling balls. Just last week, things reached a breaking point as the bowling balls' interests smashed against the opposing pins’.
<br><br>
Bowling ball union leaders are reportedly taking a hard line against any scabs. They state that any pins that dare cross their picket line will be knocked down. Union leaders especially can’t stand pins that are clearly in the lane’s pocket. These pins will be the first to fall.
<br><br>
The bowling balls will continue to strike as long as pins are on the lane. This comes as a welcome surprise to frequent bowler John Ballin. “My games have been nearly perfect lately. Thank god those bowling balls are doing that thing... Er, what did you say was happening with them again?” stated Ballin.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, this strike is coming at the worst possible time for the Jones administration. In this economy there is no way the Union Rec Room can survive the bowling ball’s strike, especially during the notoriously busy finals season. “The Rec Room pins are built on weak fundamentals, and given the circumstances I don’t think they can withstand such an impact.”

            Following the success of Netflix’s new show, “Monster”, a drama that follows the story of serial killer Jeffery Dahmer, the university has decided to recruit a serial killer of its own in a bid to regain national relevance. The university is accepting applicants from around the country, with special priority for killers targeting minority or otherwise vulnerable populations.
<br><br>
To aid in the search for young talent, UIUC has sent scouts to juvies and some of the top dysfunctional families across the country. “Watching these future nationwide phenomena in the making is really inspiring,” said one talent scout.
<br><br>
The university is reportedly finalizing talks with both their front running serial killer candidate and some potential victims and families of victims regarding the rights to the inevitable tv show/true crime podcast/documentary, though out of concern for the safety of the killer, the university has declined to release the name or M.O. of their candidate.

The administration believes strongly that by selecting the right candidate, it can make thoughts of UIUC consume the heads and hearts of America.

            Dropping out of college is a tough decision, made even tougher by the fact that you don’t get the cool-looking diploma that comes with graduating. To ease dropouts’ tough transition into the real world, the University decided that all dropouts will receive a “participation trophy” to let them know that all that matters was they tried their best and had fun.

This participation trophy does not come with any relief for debt accumulated while pursuing—but ultimately failing—to obtain a degree. Instead, it comes with an inscription that says “University participant.” If the dropout was enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering, the inscription instead reads “Just Like Mark Zuckerberg.”

“Everyone out here put up a good effort. Good hustle guys. You’ll get ‘em next time,” said the administrator as he handed out the trophies to the dropouts. “Keep your heads up high and your trophies in hand.”

            Following an anonymous donation of $200 million to the university trust, as well as donations of undisclosed values to the accounts of several high ranking members of the university administration, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has finalized its decision to open a new college focusing exclusively on public policy.
<br><br>
At a press conference following the announcement, a representative of the university made bold promises regarding the new college, declaring that their classes will be “unparalleled by any law-abiding university” and that they will “help students achieve their goals by any means possible”. Indeed, the university has already secured the ability for future students to obtain working experience through partnerships with several nationally prominent politicians.
<br><br>
New buildings planned for the college include a fake prison, which the university touts as “a way to prepare students for any real world scenario, no matter how unlikely”, as well as a field of shallow graves already dug, waiting to be filled with the bodies of suicide victims who died in improbable ways. 
<br><br>
The university also addressed some concerns regarding the new college. In response to questions raised about morality, the university gave the following statement:
<br><br>
“Well, you raise a great question about that, and I think it’s one that is really important to our core values as an institution of higher education. In these challenging times, the question you asked is especially important, so I want to let you know that we are carefully considering the answers to these questions. Now more than ever, we really have to work together to reach our goals, which include providing students from all backgrounds and identities an equitable and fair environment for learning. By the way, did you know that Tim Killeen caught COVID-19?”
<br><br>
Further questions were met with accusations of being un-American, as well as a variety of pleas to “consider the children” who might be deprived of such a world-class education should the college be canceled.

            Nothing brings out my inner child better than climbable trees. Their boughs transport me to a more carefree time when Canvas was still something you painted on. Yet when it comes time to grab the bark, I always catch myself. Surely it wouldn’t be acceptable for me to just climb a tree in front of everyone like that. Right?
<br><br>
To be sure, I spoke with our resident expert on tree climbing: Ash Oakbirch. “When considering a possible action, you always have to weigh its costs and benefits,” Ash shouted to me. "The benefit of climbing a tree is obvious. The cost is less so," he yelled from atop a dope looking tree.
<br><br>
Ash further noted that “if you’re walking with someone you want to impress, it’s ideal to pick a climbable but scary tree that you have done many times before. If you are just with friends, then feel free to pick whatever tree fits your fancy.”

            Leslie and Sarah both went to the same high school. They were in the same chemistry class their sophomore year, the same math class their junior year, and the same English class their senior year. However, the two students never had a conversation of more than 10 seconds with each other in the three years they went to high school together.
<br><br>
Now, the pair are living on the same floor of their dorm, and Leslie passes Sarah every day on her walk to Physics 212. For many, being in such close proximity would lead to some amount of awkward small talk, but not for Sarah and Leslie. When asked how she manages this, Sarah said, “I just pretend not to recognise her. It’s really easy because she changed her hairstyle and lost a few pounds since high school, so I can imagine she’s a completely different person.”

We also asked Leslie what she does to avoid this mildly awkward interaction. She responded by saying that she “changed her hairstyle and started working out so nobody from that [expletive] high school would recognise her.”

            Bella, a socially conscious sophomore, attended a barn dance with Outdoor Adventure Club last weekend. She reportedly had some reservations about barn dances representing a form of cultural appropriation, in which students, typically from suburban backgrounds, come to a barn to “cosplay as country-folk for the night.” Bella objected mildly to the premise of a barn dance, noting “a mishmash of country paraphernalia such as flannels, cowboy hats, denim jeans with white t-shirts, and authentic Missourian meth certainly feels very similar to dressing up as another culture for Halloween. That’s gotta be sort of wrong.”
<br><br>
Despite her lukewarm rebukes against widespread cultural appropriation, Bella still went to last weekend’s barn dance and enjoyed herself. “I’m not going to lie, I had a good time. When the farmer took us for a hay ride it was so fun. I just wish I could look at my reflection without feeling guilty.”
<br><br>
Other students, hearing of Bella’s predicament, resolved not to think about it too hard.

            Earlier today, the University unveiled their newest addition to campus: the Clay Material Science Building. In a very predictable twist, the building was made completely out of reddish-brown brick. One student commented that “this new building fits in really well with our style,” while pointing to the wrong building. Another student walked straight past the building, asking our correspondent, “Where is the new building?”
<br><br>
The construction of the Clay Material Science Building cost the University around $50 million, $3 million of which was earmarked for commissioning the architectural design of the building. However, John, a junior majoring in Architectural Studies, says that he could just have easily copied and pasted the design of the neighboring building and he would only charge $5.
<br><br>
University faculty are reportedly very excited to begin experiments at the new labs housed within the Clay Material Science Building. Some have even speculated that with all the extra space in this generically textured building, researchers might discover a new building material.

            Barry Lawrence, a 72 year old tenured professor of sociology, unpromptedly announced in his class today that he is ready to hop on the “Gravy train.” When questioned by an inquisitive student, Lawrence elaborated that as a professor of sociology, he is obliged to keep up with the times, so he will be attending Yung Gravy’s April 24th concert on the quad. The concert is free to all students with I-Cards, but it is unclear if Professor Lawrence will be allowed to watch the concert.
<br><br>
Furthermore, attendees are not allowed to bring any bags to the concert, but they are encouraged to bring a clear water bottle. Professor Lawrence reportedly plans on bringing a water bottle full of gravy to express his enthusiasm for the yung artist.
<br><br>
When we asked the professor if he had ever heard any of Yung Gravy’s songs, he hesitated for a moment before quietly responding, “No.” Professor Lawrence’s students are reportedly simultaneously excited and nervous to see his reaction to Yung Gravy’s music.

            University policy dictates that upon receiving a positive test for coronavirus, students must self-isolate for 7-14 days. This being the case, students who are unable to isolate at their residence are forced into isolation dorms the university has set aside. Students describe conditions as “awesome” and “the best part of my college experience.”
<br><br>
“I had my own room, food was delivered to me daily, and I didn’t have to take any tests,” said Charlene, just after leaving isolation. “Now that I’m back in society I’m struggling to catch up with my classwork and I can’t help but think that it was better there.”
<br><br>
The conditions are so “awesome” that one student, Jeff, refuses to leave, saying “I’ve found inner peace in here, while laying in bed watching anime.” Reportedly, the university is forcing Jeff out as soon as they can find security guards willing to enter the COVID dorm, but Jeff says that in this eventuality he will just do his best to contract COVID again.

            Following his victory in the 2022 Illinois Student Government elections, the Student Body President Elect Garret Forrest, along with running mate Vindhya Kalipi, organized a rally on the quad yesterday to thank their supporters.
<br><br>
Portions of his speech were dedicated to the outpouring of support from supporters that carried him to victory, as well as a bold reaffirmation of his campaign promises. He then mingled with the crowd, and personally shook every hand, a task made much easier by the fact that there were zero other people in attendance.
<br><br>
“I’m so grateful to you all,” the president-elect said to nobody. “It’s all thanks to your support that I’m here!”, said the man standing on the quad, shouting to an empty crowd.
<br><br>
While giving his speech, a handful of students walked by. We questioned one of them, Annie, to see her thoughts on the direction Garret Forrest is taking our student body. She answered our question with two questions: “Who is Garret Forrest? And since when did we have a student government?”
<br><br>
Our correspondent leaves us with a few more questions themselves. If a politician makes a promise, and no one cares to hear it, did the promise ever mean anything? And where the hell did Forrest get all those fireworks and parade floats from?

            ISR is considered by many to be the nicest dorm in the University. It only takes a glance at the décor to tell it’s expensive, and it only takes a glance at the students to tell they’re all engineers. But venture beyond the lobby with the tastefully placed couches, and you will hear a debate raging over the sound of “Gangsta’s Paradise”. A single question rings loudly: does the playlist manager deserve a fat raise or to be discharged dishonorably?
<br><br>
We interviewed some students on the scene, and over the sound of “Cotton Eye Joe”, Susanne disgustedly said, "Play a radio station or something. If you want to listen to your motley playlist of nostalgic but obnoxious hits, put in headphones. Why do we have to be subjected to this?"
<br><br>
We also asked Carl, a freshman mechanical engineering major, whether ISR’s playlist manager is doing a good job. With “Life is a Highway” playing in the background, Carl simply retorted: "The music sorta slaps. Give that man a fat raise."

            In the face of a recent surge in crime on campus, university tour guides have opted for a bold new solution to protect prospective visitors: giving each visitor a complimentary handgun, along with 12 bullets.
<br><br>
This innovative new policy promises to completely deter criminals and various undesirables, such as harassers, solicitors, the homeless, and students still afraid to die, from entering a 20 meter radius around tour groups, ensuring complete safety.
<br><br>
Our correspondent was capable of reaching Mr. Shoot, head of public relations and chief architect of this new policy, who noted the necessity of this measure, saying, “Danger could strike any moment that visitors are on campus”, while citing the 21 reported instances of firearm discharge since the policy was instituted yesterday.
<br><br>
Responses to further questions were precluded, as Mr. Shoot became belligerent and reached towards his hip, at which point our brave correspondent quickly excused themselves from the room.
