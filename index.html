                            December 3, 2022
                                
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following the improvement in skill of many of the Union Bowling Alley’s bowlers, tensions have been high among the bowling balls. Just last week, things reached a breaking point as the bowling ball’s interests smashed against the opposing pins’.
<br><br>
Bowling ball union leaders are reportedly taking a hard line against any scabs. They state that any pins that dare cross their picket line will be knocked down. Union leaders especially can’t stand pins that are clearly in the lane’s pocket. These pins will be the first to fall.
<br><br>
The bowling balls will continue to strike as long as pins are on the lane. This comes as a welcome surprise to frequent bowler John Ballin. “My games have been nearly perfect lately. Thank god those bowling balls are doing that thing... Er, what did you say was happening with them again?” stated Ballin.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, this strike is coming at the worst possible time for the Jones administration. In this economy there is no way the Union Rec Room can survive the bowling ball’s strike, especially during the notoriously busy finals season. “The Rec Room pins are built on weak fundamentals, and given the circumstances I don’t think they can withstand such an impact.”

            Obesity is an epidemic that flies under the radar on a college campus. Living in a place where dining halls are all you can eat and alcohol is the main coping mechanism doesn’t tend to do wonders for your BMI. Knowing that these things are massive issues, we talked to one student determined to fight the problem. 
<br><br>
Ashley, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, put her knowledge to use and devised a novel 12 step program to help students get back in shape. “My new program is an incredibly simple 12 steps. These steps really are the path you need to take to get fit. All you have to do is climb one step after another, and eventually you get to the place that fit people go.”
<br><br>
When asked how she thought of these 12 steps, Ashley responded, “It’s simple really. There are 12 steps in front of the ARC entrance.”

            Our science correspondent reports that there was a massive breakthrough in a lab this morning. “Eureka!” scientists shrieked as they shattered barriers previously known to be solid. “We just like pushing things to their limits as fast as we can,” explained a sheepish scientist in an oversized lab coat.
<br><br>
Not everyone is so excited about this development, though. This breakthrough has triggered some calls to rein in progress. “When my coworker first started making headway towards the lab window with his research, I told him that I don’t think this step is the right direction. Nevertheless, he pressed on,” said a skeptical scientist. “I just wish we could think through the ramifications of our actions.”

“Sometimes I get so preoccupied with thinking about whether I can smash barriers, I forget to think about whether I should. In the future, I promise to be more careful," said the sheepish scientist.

Worried, our correspondent pulled our writer back  to his feet. When asked about what caused this breakdown, our writer responded “I found myself crushed by an avalanche of work.

            Dropping out of college is a tough decision, made even tougher by the fact that you don’t get the cool-looking diploma that comes with graduating. To ease dropouts’ tough transition into the real world, the University decided that all dropouts will receive a “participation trophy” to let them know that all that matters was they tried their best and had fun.
<br><br>
This participation trophy does not come with any relief for debt accumulated while pursuing—but ultimately failing—to obtain a degree. Instead, it comes with an inscription that says “University participant.” If the dropout was enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering, the inscription instead reads “Just Like Mark Zuckerberg.”
<br><br>
“Everyone out here put up a good effort. Good hustle guys. You’ll get ‘em next time,” said the administrator as he handed out the trophies to the dropouts. “Keep your heads up high and your trophies in hand.”

            Dropping out of college is a tough decision, made even tougher by the fact that you don’t get the cool-looking diploma that comes with graduating. To ease dropouts’ tough transition into the real world, the University decided that all dropouts will receive a “participation trophy” to let them know that all that matters was they tried their best and had fun.
<br><br>
This participation trophy does not come with any relief for debt accumulated while pursuing—but ultimately failing—to obtain a degree. Instead, it comes with an inscription that says “University participant.” If the dropout was enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering, the inscription instead reads “Just Like Mark Zuckerberg.”
<br><br>
“Everyone out here put up a good effort. Good hustle guys. You’ll get ‘em next time,” said the administrator as he handed out the trophies to the dropouts. “Keep your heads up high and your trophies in hand.”
