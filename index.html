                        <p class="blog-post-meta">
                            January 22, 2023

                            After perusing the available undergraduate science degrees on offer at our esteemed university, many students end up choosing a B.S. in Elementary Education, where campus administrators are more than happy to put the ‘E’ in “STEM”. However, after pursuing this degree for no less than three years, one future Elementary Education graduate was shocked to find that at the end of the college experience lies the untold horrors of the classroom. 
<br><br>
Nicole, whose real name we have anonymized to protect her identity, gave us an eyewitness testimony of the duplicity at the core of the College of Education. “I really feel deceived,” she claims, “I thought I would be an advanced student because I already knew my shapes and colors.” But it seems that department heads had other plans. Within the core coursework are classes such as “Child Psychological Development” and “Naptime 370,” which students are woefully unprepared for and involve time in real classrooms with real children. 
<br><br>
According to Nicole, “There is a radical difference between the Theory of Preventative Crayon Eating and Applied Silent Reading Time and I can barely bring it all together.” She told us harrowing stories of having to go into enclosed labs and interact with people under the age of twelve. These so-called “teaching experiences” seem impossible, as students are required to make tiny people understand big subjects such as math and science, all while stopping them from pulling hair and putting stationary up their noses.
<br><br>
This callous disregard for the body of students who actually take the courses, do the work, and attend the lectures – all before monday night Lion – shows how out of touch school faculty is. “It’s very disheartening and I can imagine how the alienation can really kill the dream for a lot of us,” Nicole said; “All I wanted to do was hit on future frat guys as an English teacher, now I’m responsible for shaping the next generation.”
<br><br>
Her impassioned words resonate with those of all majors, and all of us here at the Nightly Illini hope things will get better.

            Michael, a sophomore, barely survived his finals. Now that he has a moment to breathe, he started to scope out his professors for next semester. Hoping that doing his due diligence a bit late wouldn’t screw him over, Michael checked the GPA Visualization for his classes, only to find the only professor for his class has a 2.10 average GPA. Every other professor boasted a 3.0 or above average GPA.
<br><br>
“I would take it next semester but I really need the prereq,” Michael said tearfully. “I really have to take this class.” Desperate for a ray of hope, Michael did some more research.
<br><br>
“Some Reddit user says his sections are really easy, but his comment has like 20 downvotes. He has a 0.69 quality rating and a 4.20 difficulty rating on Rate My Professors. That better be a joke. One of my friends knows someone who took the class, and he says I’m screwed.”
<br><br>
After hearing this heartbreaking news, Michael can be found walking home in the rain, tears streaming down his face, yelling “WHYYYY???”

            Rumors about UIUC’s endowment circulated throughout campus today. According to one student, the endowment has ballooned to the massive size of $3.82 billion. That’s well above average for schools of UIUC’s stature.
<br><br>
Some students have expressed concern about how the University fits that huge thing in its treasury. Anna remarked, “Not that I spend a lot of time looking down there, but if I did I’m sure I would see a huge bulge from trying to fit such a monstrous quantity of stuff in its confines. It must be so filled up right now…” At this point, Anna trailed off and blushed.
<br><br>
The administrators have noted that a strong endowment is like a thick tree trunk that sows the seeds for future generations of Illini. As to the precise size of the endowment, the administrators have not given any official comment except for a sly smirk and the words “it’s big, alright”.

            René Thomas contracted the bubonic plague while messing around with an electron microscope and some virus samples with some friends. “It’s amazing what you can buy on Amazon these days,” said the junior biology student.
<br><br>
The plague promises to feast on the vitality of the campus’ youth, leaving nothing but empty husks in its wake. René will soon experience gangrene, swollen buboes, and intense sickness.
<br><br>
This news predictably weighs heavily on the minds of students. “When I heard René got the plague, I started totally freaking out. Not like freaking out freaking out. I mean it’s 2022 who even cares about the plague anymore. It still sucks for him though,” said Lindsey, a friend of René.
<br><br>
With René’s careless actions, the scourge of the pestilence has risen its 800 year slumber to wreak havoc on a scale never before seen. Students are encouraged to wear masks and stuff their pockets full of posies to ward off the evil menace of the Black Death.
<br><br>
These guidelines are getting some pushback from the students. “Preventative measures are like, so 2020. Sorry not sorry,” said Olivia. “You guys seriously want me to walk around wearing a mask like some latter-day hippy?? And posies are basic AF by the way.”
<br><br>
One can only hope that life will return to normal as soon as possible.

            Following the improvement in skill of many of the Union Bowling Alley’s bowlers, tensions have been high among the bowling balls. Just last week, things reached a breaking point as the bowling balls' interests smashed against the opposing pins’.
<br><br>
Bowling ball union leaders are reportedly taking a hard line against any scabs. They state that any pins that dare cross their picket line will be knocked down. Union leaders especially can’t stand pins that are clearly in the lane’s pocket. These pins will be the first to fall.
<br><br>
The bowling balls will continue to strike as long as pins are on the lane. This comes as a welcome surprise to frequent bowler John Ballin. “My games have been nearly perfect lately. Thank god those bowling balls are doing that thing... Er, what did you say was happening with them again?” stated Ballin.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, this strike is coming at the worst possible time for the Jones administration. In this economy there is no way the Union Rec Room can survive the bowling ball’s strike, especially during the notoriously busy finals season. “The Rec Room pins are built on weak fundamentals, and given the circumstances I don’t think they can withstand such an impact.”

            Obesity is an epidemic that flies under the radar on a college campus. Living in a place where dining halls are all you can eat and alcohol is the main coping mechanism doesn’t tend to do wonders for your BMI. Knowing that these things are massive issues, we talked to one student determined to fight the problem. 
<br><br>
Ashley, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, put her knowledge to use and devised a novel 12 step program to help students get back in shape. “My new program is an incredibly simple 12 steps. These steps really are the path you need to take to get fit. All you have to do is climb one step after another, and eventually you get to the place that fit people go.”
<br><br>
When asked how she thought of these 12 steps, Ashley responded, “It’s simple really. There are 12 steps in front of the ARC entrance.”

1. Nobel Prize for Physics (1956)<br>Winning this prize was pretty impressive. 10/10

            Our science correspondent reports that there was a massive breakthrough in a lab this morning. “Eureka!” scientists shrieked as they shattered barriers previously known to be solid. “We just like pushing things to their limits as fast as we can,” explained a sheepish scientist in an oversized lab coat.
<br><br>
Not everyone is so excited about this development, though. This breakthrough has triggered some calls to rein in progress. “When my coworker first started making headway towards the lab window with his research, I told him that I don’t think this step is the right direction. Nevertheless, he pressed on,” said a skeptical scientist. “I just wish we could think through the ramifications of our actions.”
<br><br>
“Sometimes I get so preoccupied with thinking about whether I can smash barriers, I forget to think about whether I should. In the future, I promise to be more careful," said the sheepish scientist.

            Following the success of Netflix’s new show, “Monster”, a drama that follows the story of serial killer Jeffery Dahmer, the university has decided to recruit a serial killer of its own in a bid to regain national relevance. The university is accepting applicants from around the country, with special priority for killers targeting minority or otherwise vulnerable populations.
<br><br>
To aid in the search for young talent, UIUC has sent scouts to juvies and some of the top dysfunctional families across the country. “Watching these future nationwide phenomena in the making is really inspiring,” said one talent scout.
<br><br>
The university is reportedly finalizing talks with both their front running serial killer candidate and some potential victims and families of victims regarding the rights to the inevitable tv show/true crime podcast/documentary, though out of concern for the safety of the killer, the university has declined to release the name or M.O. of their candidate. 
<br><br>
The administration believes strongly that by selecting the right candidate, it can make thoughts of UIUC consume the heads and hearts of America.

After weeks of no contact or Nightly Illini stories written, our very busy correspondent became worried about our writer.

Worried, our correspondent pulled our writer back  to his feet. When asked about what caused this breakdown, our writer responded “I found myself crushed by an avalanche of work.

            Dropping out of college is a tough decision, made even tougher by the fact that you don’t get the cool-looking diploma that comes with graduating. To ease dropouts’ tough transition into the real world, the University decided that all dropouts will receive a “participation trophy” to let them know that all that matters was they tried their best and had fun.
<br><br>
This participation trophy does not come with any relief for debt accumulated while pursuing—but ultimately failing—to obtain a degree. Instead, it comes with an inscription that says “University participant.” If the dropout was enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering, the inscription instead reads “Just Like Mark Zuckerberg.”
<br><br>
“Everyone out here put up a good effort. Good hustle guys. You’ll get ‘em next time,” said the administrator as he handed out the trophies to the dropouts. “Keep your heads up high and your trophies in hand.”

            Michael, a sophomore, barely survived his finals. Now that he has a moment to breathe, he started to scope out his professors for next semester. Hoping that doing his due diligence a bit late wouldn’t screw him over, Michael checked the GPA Visualization for his classes, only to find the only professor for his class has a 2.10 average GPA. Every other professor boasted a 3.0 or above average GPA.
<br><br>
“I would take it next semester but I really need the prereq,” Michael said tearfully. “I really have to take this class.” Desperate for a ray of hope, Michael did some more research.
<br><br>
“Some Reddit user says his sections are really easy, but his comment has like 20 downvotes. He has a 0.69 quality rating and a 4.20 difficulty rating on Rate My Professors. That better be a joke. One of my friends knows someone who took the class, and he says I’m screwed.”
<br><br>
After hearing this heartbreaking news, Michael can be found walking home in the rain, tears streaming down his face, yelling “WHYYYY???”

            René Thomas contracted the bubonic plague while messing around with an electron microscope and some virus samples with some friends. “It’s amazing what you can buy on Amazon these days,” said the junior biology student.
<br><br>
The plague promises to feast on the vitality of the campus’ youth, leaving nothing but empty husks in its wake. René will soon experience gangrene, swollen buboes, and intense sickness.
<br><br>
This news predictably weighs heavily on the minds of students. “When I heard René got the plague, I started totally freaking out. Not like freaking out freaking out. I mean it’s 2022 who even cares about the plague anymore. It still sucks for him though,” said Lindsey, a friend of René.
<br><br>
With René’s careless actions, the scourge of the pestilence has risen its 800 year slumber to wreak havoc on a scale never before seen. Students are encouraged to wear masks and stuff their pockets full of posies to ward off the evil menace of the Black Death.
<br><br>
These guidelines are getting some pushback from the students. “Preventative measures are like, so 2020. Sorry not sorry,” said Olivia. “You guys seriously want me to walk around wearing a mask like some latter-day hippy?? And posies are basic AF by the way.”
<br><br>
One can only hope that life will return to normal as soon as possible.

            Obesity is an epidemic that flies under the radar on a college campus. Living in a place where dining halls are all you can eat and alcohol is the main coping mechanism doesn’t tend to do wonders for your BMI. Knowing that these things are massive issues, we talked to one student determined to fight the problem. 
<br><br>
Ashley, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, put her knowledge to use and devised a novel 12 step program to help students get back in shape. “My new program is an incredibly simple 12 steps. These steps really are the path you need to take to get fit. All you have to do is climb one step after another, and eventually you get to the place that fit people go.”
<br><br>
When asked how she thought of these 12 steps, Ashley responded, “It’s simple really. There are 12 steps in front of the ARC entrance.”

            Our science correspondent reports that there was a massive breakthrough in a lab this morning. “Eureka!” scientists shrieked as they shattered barriers previously known to be solid. “We just like pushing things to their limits as fast as we can,” explained a sheepish scientist in an oversized lab coat.
<br><br>
Not everyone is so excited about this development, though. This breakthrough has triggered some calls to rein in progress. “When my coworker first started making headway towards the lab window with his research, I told him that I don’t think this step is the right direction. Nevertheless, he pressed on,” said a skeptical scientist. “I just wish we could think through the ramifications of our actions.”
<br><br>
“Sometimes I get so preoccupied with thinking about whether I can smash barriers, I forget to think about whether I should. In the future, I promise to be more careful," said the sheepish scientist.

            Upon returning to campus our correspondent was “very busy with school” and “on the grind this semester”. After weeks of no contact or Nightly Illini stories written, our very busy correspondent became worried about our writer. He stopped by our writer’s apartment, only to find him on the floor, despondent, with a few incoherent Nightly Illini article ideas scribbled in crayon on half a sheet of notebook paper.
<br><br>
Worried, our correspondent pulled our writer back  to his feet. When asked about what caused this breakdown, our writer responded “I found myself crushed by an avalanche of work. The avalanche was seemingly caused by a small shift in deadlines, causing a tremor in the mountains of work I was going through. ”
<br><br>
Our writer then promised that he would be more careful in the future but made no promises.

            Rumors about UIUC’s endowment circulated throughout campus today. According to one student, the endowment has ballooned to the massive size of $3.82 billion. That’s well above average for schools of UIUC’s stature.
<br><br>
Some students have expressed concern about how the University fits that huge thing in its treasury. Anna remarked, “Not that I spend a lot of time looking down there, but if I did I’m sure I would see a huge bulge from trying to fit such a monstrous quantity of stuff in its confines. It must be so filled up right now…” At this point, Anna trailed off and blushed.
<br><br>
The administrators have noted that a strong endowment is like a thick tree trunk that sows the seeds for future generations of Illini. As to the precise size of the endowment, the administrators have not given any official comment except for a sly smirk and the words “it’s big, alright”.

            Following the improvement in skill of many of the Union Bowling Alley’s bowlers, tensions have been high among the bowling balls. Just last week, things reached a breaking point as the bowling balls' interests smashed against the opposing pins’.
<br><br>
Bowling ball union leaders are reportedly taking a hard line against any scabs. They state that any pins that dare cross their picket line will be knocked down. Union leaders especially can’t stand pins that are clearly in the lane’s pocket. These pins will be the first to fall.
<br><br>
The bowling balls will continue to strike as long as pins are on the lane. This comes as a welcome surprise to frequent bowler John Ballin. “My games have been nearly perfect lately. Thank god those bowling balls are doing that thing... Er, what did you say was happening with them again?” stated Ballin.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, this strike is coming at the worst possible time for the Jones administration. In this economy there is no way the Union Rec Room can survive the bowling ball’s strike, especially during the notoriously busy finals season. “The Rec Room pins are built on weak fundamentals, and given the circumstances I don’t think they can withstand such an impact.”

            The highest honor that a scientist can get is the Nobel Prize. Getting the gold not only wins you universal recognition, but also a cash prize of over one million dollars.
<br><br>
John Bardeen, a former faculty member at UIUC, was a serial Nobel Prize winner. Some even go so far as to call him the Nobel GOAT. Here we will painstakingly enumerate all of Bardeen’s wins and rank them by impressiveness.
<br><br>
1. Nobel Prize for Physics (1956)<br>Winning this prize was pretty impressive. 10/10
<br><br>
2. Nobel Prize for Physics (1972)<br>Winning this prize was great, but not wholly unexpected, given Bardeen’s past record. 9/10

            Following the success of Netflix’s new show, “Monster”, a drama that follows the story of serial killer Jeffery Dahmer, the university has decided to recruit a serial killer of its own in a bid to regain national relevance. The university is accepting applicants from around the country, with special priority for killers targeting minority or otherwise vulnerable populations.
<br><br>
To aid in the search for young talent, UIUC has sent scouts to juvies and some of the top dysfunctional families across the country. “Watching these future nationwide phenomena in the making is really inspiring,” said one talent scout.
<br><br>
The university is reportedly finalizing talks with both their front running serial killer candidate and some potential victims and families of victims regarding the rights to the inevitable tv show/true crime podcast/documentary, though out of concern for the safety of the killer, the university has declined to release the name or M.O. of their candidate. 
<br><br>
The administration believes strongly that by selecting the right candidate, it can make thoughts of UIUC consume the heads and hearts of America.

            Dropping out of college is a tough decision, made even tougher by the fact that you don’t get the cool-looking diploma that comes with graduating. To ease dropouts’ tough transition into the real world, the University decided that all dropouts will receive a “participation trophy” to let them know that all that matters was they tried their best and had fun.
<br><br>
This participation trophy does not come with any relief for debt accumulated while pursuing—but ultimately failing—to obtain a degree. Instead, it comes with an inscription that says “University participant.” If the dropout was enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering, the inscription instead reads “Just Like Mark Zuckerberg.”
<br><br>
“Everyone out here put up a good effort. Good hustle guys. You’ll get ‘em next time,” said the administrator as he handed out the trophies to the dropouts. “Keep your heads up high and your trophies in hand.”
