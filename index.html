                            This morning the city of Champaign elected to replace the decrepit Illini Hall with another student apartment highrise named “The Provost.” The new building, to be owned by Wright Street American Realty Town Rentals, serves two purposes according to campus spokespeople: firstly, to increase housing options around campus and, secondly, to give students another chance at forgetting that they aren’t in a real city.
<br><br>
“We are aware that our campus attracts a variety of students hailing all sorts of large cities; from Chicago suburbs to the Bay Area all the way to large cities in Asia like Taiwan” said one council member. He later elaborated, “It is the Jones administration's hope that through erecting more towers, increasing light pollution, and only building bubble tea shops, we can trick students from these densely populated areas into thinking that we have a shining metropolis in a corn field.
<br><br>
The Director of Housing at UIUC, Alma Sealine, commented “When I can’t sleep I like to take long walks in the night. I look up at the lights of these magnificent skyscrapers I’ve approved and unload my handgun in random directions. Anything to make these kids feel like they are in a real city.” 
<br><br>
“The administration had a rousing success last year in regards to tricking Ava Max, and we were hoping to replicate it with other C-list celebrities and the incoming class of 2027” said another council member. We here at the Nightly Illini wish them luck.

            For the last 65 years, the Grammys have been a prestigious award, honoring the best songs of the year. However, this prestige comes with significant controversy, as critics perceive elitism and bad decisions behind every unpopular winner and each unexpected snub. However, this year, these criticisms have come to a head, as the Grammys have committed their greatest sin so far:
<br><br>
Refusing to honor the UIUC official song, "Hail to the Orange".
<br><br>
Indeed, this song's one hundred year old legacy that predates the Grammys itself has somehow failed to be noticed by the Academy, in a move we can only attribute to malice. How could they fail to honor the university ranked as the 41st best by US News and World Report? Did they not notice that our football team is having an above average season? Where is the credit given to our prestigious top ten ranking in party schools? Surely these things merit at least a nomination.
<br><br>
This year marks the last straw, as it seems like the Grammys will never shed their century-long anti-Illini bias. In response, I call upon all readers to disregard the Grammys and their fraudulent awards, and seek bluer and oranger pastures elsewhere.

            Raising Cane’s is officially waiting to open until construction is finished, staff is hired, and there is peace in the Middle East. “We just really want to make sure we are ready for this grand opening,” said the store manager. According to inside sources, the much anticipated restaurant Raising Cane’s will indeed be opening soon(ish). “You didn’t hear it from me, but word on the street is that the planned opening date is February 28th, 1.7×10<sup>106</sup> CE, shortly before the heat death of the universe,” said our informant.
<br><br>
This concrete date will surely hearten the many Caniacs anticipating the grand opening. There is already a line of people camping outside the building to be the first to gaze out into the endless void while enjoying the restaurant’s delicious Texas Toast. “I think that after the stars burn out, the black holes evaporate, and the very fabric of our existence decays, some chicken fingers will really hit,” said one camper.
<br><br>
Reportedly, the Cane’s plans to celebrate the opening by giving out copies of Half-Life 3. This is exciting news indeed.

            The Alma statue has a storied history as a campus landmark, standing tall on campus for nearly a hundred years. From where it currently resides in front of Altgeld Hall, it welcomes visitors to the campus from near and far, earning it no small measure of fame.
<br><br>
However, this fame comes at a steep cost. Paparazzi and various gawkers harass the statue with pictures and selfies at almost all hours of the day. Without any respite, Alma is forced to continuously pose in place for days, or even months at a time. To make matters worse, rumors on campus abound of a 24 hour camera fixed on Alma, continuously broadcasting any tiny action to the whole world. This intense scrutiny represents a brutal invasion of privacy, and we should take some time to remember that, despite its fame, Alma is just another 10,000 pound bronze statue, no different from you and me.
<br><br>
The Nightly Illini was unable to reach Alma for comment before publication. However, we remain certain that the statue would object, if it weren't being silenced by the university, who allegedly sponsors such invasions of privacy.

            Denizens of one apartment on Green Street have been struggling with mysterious food disappearances over the last 6 months. Occasionally, food would simply disappear from the fridge, dirty dishes would be left in the kitchen, and size 12 muddy footprints would appear. No conclusive evidence has been discovered as to the source of these disturbances, but residents have their own theories.
<br><br>
Zach, shoe size 12, was the first we interviewed, suggesting that it was "probably a ghost or something, bro", and that "it totally didn't have anything to do with him." However, other roommates maintain that these problems are, in fact, originating from one of the earthly residents of the apartment. Without any consensus on the matter, the residents are at a loss as to the best course of action. Some questions asked by the concerned residents include, "Maybe you guys can pay for, like, an exorcist or something?", and "is it too late to kick this guy off the lease?"
<br><br>
Indeed, it appears this mystery will remain unsolved, as neither side has offered any conclusive evidence.

            In the past year, M&M has made a number of changes to the spokescandies commonly featured in their commercials. They swapped out the brown M&M’s stilettos for blockier heels and the green M&M’s boots for sneakers, among a few other changes.
<br><br>
These changes to the beloved characters provoked intense controversy. “Sexy M&M’s were the backbone of our society” noted one commentator. ”M&M will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous.”
<br><br>
In response to the controversy, M&M indefinitely suspended the use of their spokescandies. UIUC, of course, lunged at the opportunity, making the Orange M&M our new mascot. What M&M so heartlessly kicked to the curb, the administration adopted with loving care. Even better, UIUC redesigned the orange M&M to have 8 inch stilettos, fishnet stockings, and thick black eyeliner.
<br><br>
The administration stated that, “after a decade and a half of searching we finally found a true successor to the Chief. Sexy Orange M&M is what we as a university, and really as a society, need right now. Go Fighting Sexy Orange M&M’s!”

            Every University of Illinois student is familiar with Green Street, the bustling downtown of campus. Lined with restaurants, shops, and high-rise apartments, there’s never a dull moment for the countless students passing through.
<br><br>
With so much daily foot traffic, many residents have proposed turning the portion of Green Street between First and Wright into a European-style promenade, with outdoor seating, safe bike paths, and ornamental foliage.
<br><br>
However, Green Street also serves as one of the main roads leading into the sister cities of Urbana and Champaign, connecting to Neil Street and branching to major highways.
<br><br>
Following tense debate, the Champaign-Urbana Motor Department of Transportation finally made a firm decision on Monday, banning all pedestrians from Green Street stores, sidewalks, and other concrete.
<br><br>
“Green Street is like the aorta for the burgeoning heart that is the Urbana-Champaign community” said one spokesman for the CUMDOT in our correspondence. “Pedestrians are like cholesterol, blocking the veins and arteries—preventing cars from getting through. So, we stand strongly behind our decision.”
<br><br>
We also spoke to the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan-area Chamber of Commerce about the economic impacts of the decision.
<br><br>
“Pedestrians, for years, have prevented a pivot to the highly-profitable drive-through model. Now, students will be able to munch on a pizza from Mia Za’s, or sip on a Blue Guy from KAM’S, all in the comfort of their own car,” said Kirby Neil, head of expansion at CUMCOC. 
<br><br>
Despite these changes, the bike lane will still be available for Doordash parking. Just make sure to hit the ‘park anywhere’ triangle.
<br><br>
We’re excited to see all the new changes this move will bring to campustown.

            After perusing the available undergraduate science degrees on offer at our esteemed university, many students end up choosing a B.S. in Elementary Education, where campus administrators are more than happy to put the ‘E’ in “STEM”. However, after pursuing this degree for no less than three years, one future Elementary Education graduate was shocked to find that at the end of the college experience lies the untold horrors of the classroom. 
<br><br>
Nicole, whose real name we have anonymized to protect her identity, gave us an eyewitness testimony of the duplicity at the core of the College of Education. “I really feel deceived,” she claims, “I thought I would be an advanced student because I already knew my shapes and colors.” But it seems that department heads had other plans. Within the core coursework are classes such as “Child Psychological Development” and “Naptime 370,” which students are woefully unprepared for and involve time in real classrooms with real children. 
<br><br>
According to Nicole, “There is a radical difference between the Theory of Preventative Crayon Eating and Applied Silent Reading Time and I can barely bring it all together.” She told us harrowing stories of having to go into enclosed labs and interact with people under the age of twelve. These so-called “teaching experiences” seem impossible, as students are required to make tiny people understand big subjects such as math and science, all while stopping them from pulling hair and putting stationary up their noses.
<br><br>
This callous disregard for the body of students who actually take the courses, do the work, and attend the lectures – all before monday night Lion – shows how out of touch school faculty is. “It’s very disheartening and I can imagine how the alienation can really kill the dream for a lot of us,” Nicole said; “All I wanted to do was hit on future frat guys as an English teacher, now I’m responsible for shaping the next generation.”
<br><br>
Her impassioned words resonate with those of all majors, and all of us here at the Nightly Illini hope things will get better.

            Michael, a sophomore, barely survived his finals. Now that he has a moment to breathe, he started to scope out his professors for next semester. Hoping that doing his due diligence a bit late wouldn’t screw him over, Michael checked the GPA Visualization for his classes, only to find the only professor for his class has a 2.10 average GPA. Every other professor boasted a 3.0 or above average GPA.
<br><br>
“I would take it next semester but I really need the prereq,” Michael said tearfully. “I really have to take this class.” Desperate for a ray of hope, Michael did some more research.
<br><br>
“Some Reddit user says his sections are really easy, but his comment has like 20 downvotes. He has a 0.69 quality rating and a 4.20 difficulty rating on Rate My Professors. That better be a joke. One of my friends knows someone who took the class, and he says I’m screwed.”

            Rumors about UIUC’s endowment circulated throughout campus today. According to one student, the endowment has ballooned to the massive size of $3.82 billion. That’s well above average for schools of UIUC’s stature.
<br><br>
Some students have expressed concern about how the University fits that huge thing in its treasury. Anna remarked, “Not that I spend a lot of time looking down there, but if I did I’m sure I would see a huge bulge from trying to fit such a monstrous quantity of stuff in its confines.

            For the last 65 years, the Grammys have been a prestigious award, honoring the best songs of the year. However, this prestige comes with significant controversy, as critics perceive elitism and bad decisions behind every unpopular winner and each unexpected snub. However, this year, these criticisms have come to a head, as the Grammys have committed their greatest sin so far:
<br><br>
Refusing to honor the UIUC official song, "Hail to the Orange".
<br><br>
Indeed, this song's one hundred year old legacy that predates the Grammys itself has somehow failed to be noticed by the Academy, in a move we can only attribute to malice. How could they fail to honor the university ranked as the 41st best by US News and World Report? Did they not notice that our football team is having an above average season? Where is the credit given to our prestigious top ten ranking in party schools? Surely these things merit at least a nomination.
<br><br>
This year marks the last straw, as it seems like the Grammys will never shed their century-long anti-Illini bias. In response, I call upon all readers to disregard the Grammys and their fraudulent awards, and seek bluer and oranger pastures elsewhere.

            The Alma statue has a storied history as a campus landmark, standing tall on campus for nearly a hundred years. From where it currently resides in front of Altgeld Hall, it welcomes visitors to the campus from near and far, earning it no small measure of fame.
<br><br>
However, this fame comes at a steep cost. Paparazzi and various gawkers harass the statue with pictures and selfies at almost all hours of the day. Without any respite, Alma is forced to continuously pose in place for days, or even months at a time. To make matters worse, rumors on campus abound of a 24 hour camera fixed on Alma, continuously broadcasting any tiny action to the whole world. This intense scrutiny represents a brutal invasion of privacy, and we should take some time to remember that, despite its fame, Alma is just another 10,000 pound bronze statue, no different from you and me.
<br><br>
The Nightly Illini was unable to reach Alma for comment before publication. However, we remain certain that the statue would object, if it weren't being silenced by the university, who allegedly sponsors such invasions of privacy.

            Every University of Illinois student is familiar with Green Street, the bustling downtown of campus. Lined with restaurants, shops, and high-rise apartments, there’s never a dull moment for the countless students passing through.
<br><br>
With so much daily foot traffic, many residents have proposed turning the portion of Green Street between First and Wright into a European-style promenade, with outdoor seating, safe bike paths, and ornamental foliage.
<br><br>
However, Green Street also serves as one of the main roads leading into the sister cities of Urbana and Champaign, connecting to Neil Street and branching to major highways.
<br><br>
Following tense debate, the Champaign-Urbana Motor Department of Transportation finally made a firm decision on Monday, banning all pedestrians from Green Street stores, sidewalks, and other concrete.
<br><br>
“Green Street is like the aorta for the burgeoning heart that is the Urbana-Champaign community” said one spokesman for the CUMDOT in our correspondence. “Pedestrians are like cholesterol, blocking the veins and arteries—preventing cars from getting through. So, we stand strongly behind our decision.”
<br><br>
We also spoke to the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan-area Chamber of Commerce about the economic impacts of the decision.
<br><br>
“Pedestrians, for years, have prevented a pivot to the highly-profitable drive-through model. Now, students will be able to munch on a pizza from Mia Za’s, or sip on a Blue Guy from KAM’S, all in the comfort of their own car,” said Kirby Neil, head of expansion at CUMCOC. 
<br><br>
Despite these changes, the bike lane will still be available for Doordash parking. Just make sure to hit the ‘park anywhere’ triangle.
<br><br>
We’re excited to see all the new changes this move will bring to campustown.

            Michael, a sophomore, barely survived his finals. Now that he has a moment to breathe, he started to scope out his professors for next semester. Hoping that doing his due diligence a bit late wouldn’t screw him over, Michael checked the GPA Visualization for his classes, only to find the only professor for his class has a 2.10 average GPA. Every other professor boasted a 3.0 or above average GPA.
<br><br>
“I would take it next semester but I really need the prereq,” Michael said tearfully. “I really have to take this class.” Desperate for a ray of hope, Michael did some more research.
<br><br>
“Some Reddit user says his sections are really easy, but his comment has like 20 downvotes. He has a 0.69 quality rating and a 4.20 difficulty rating on Rate My Professors. That better be a joke. One of my friends knows someone who took the class, and he says I’m screwed.”
<br><br>
After hearing this heartbreaking news, Michael can be found walking home in the rain, tears streaming down his face, yelling “WHYYYY???”

This concrete date will surely hearten the many Caniacs anticipating the grand opening.

            Denizens of one apartment on Green Street have been struggling with mysterious food disappearances over the last 6 months. Occasionally, food would simply disappear from the fridge, dirty dishes would be left in the kitchen, and size 12 muddy footprints would appear. No conclusive evidence has been discovered as to the source of these disturbances, but residents have their own theories.
<br><br>
Zach, shoe size 12, was the first we interviewed, suggesting that it was "probably a ghost or something, bro", and that "it totally didn't have anything to do with him." However, other roommates maintain that these problems are, in fact, originating from one of the earthly residents of the apartment. Without any consensus on the matter, the residents are at a loss as to the best course of action. Some questions asked by the concerned residents include, "Maybe you guys can pay for, like, an exorcist or something?", and "is it too late to kick this guy off the lease?"
<br><br>
Indeed, it appears this mystery will remain unsolved, as neither side has offered any conclusive evidence.

            In the past year, M&M has made a number of changes to the spokescandies commonly featured in their commercials. They swapped out the brown M&M’s stilettos for blockier heels and the green M&M’s boots for sneakers, among a few other changes.
<br><br>
These changes to the beloved characters provoked intense controversy. “Sexy M&M’s were the backbone of our society” noted one commentator. ”M&M will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous.”
<br><br>
In response to the controversy, M&M indefinitely suspended the use of their spokescandies. UIUC, of course, lunged at the opportunity, making the Orange M&M our new mascot. What M&M so heartlessly kicked to the curb, the administration adopted with loving care. Even better, UIUC redesigned the orange M&M to have 8 inch stilettos, fishnet stockings, and thick black eyeliner.
<br><br>
The administration stated that, “after a decade and a half of searching we finally found a true successor to the Chief. Sexy Orange M&M is what we as a university, and really as a society, need right now. Go Fighting Sexy Orange M&M’s!”

            After perusing the available undergraduate science degrees on offer at our esteemed university, many students end up choosing a B.S. in Elementary Education, where campus administrators are more than happy to put the ‘E’ in “STEM”. However, after pursuing this degree for no less than three years, one future Elementary Education graduate was shocked to find that at the end of the college experience lies the untold horrors of the classroom. 
<br><br>
Nicole, whose real name we have anonymized to protect her identity, gave us an eyewitness testimony of the duplicity at the core of the College of Education. “I really feel deceived,” she claims, “I thought I would be an advanced student because I already knew my shapes and colors.” But it seems that department heads had other plans. Within the core coursework are classes such as “Child Psychological Development” and “Naptime 370,” which students are woefully unprepared for and involve time in real classrooms with real children. 
<br><br>
According to Nicole, “There is a radical difference between the Theory of Preventative Crayon Eating and Applied Silent Reading Time and I can barely bring it all together.” She told us harrowing stories of having to go into enclosed labs and interact with people under the age of twelve. These so-called “teaching experiences” seem impossible, as students are required to make tiny people understand big subjects such as math and science, all while stopping them from pulling hair and putting stationary up their noses.
<br><br>
This callous disregard for the body of students who actually take the courses, do the work, and attend the lectures – all before monday night Lion – shows how out of touch school faculty is. “It’s very disheartening and I can imagine how the alienation can really kill the dream for a lot of us,” Nicole said; “All I wanted to do was hit on future frat guys as an English teacher, now I’m responsible for shaping the next generation.”
<br><br>
Her impassioned words resonate with those of all majors, and all of us here at the Nightly Illini hope things will get better.

            Rumors about UIUC’s endowment circulated throughout campus today. According to one student, the endowment has ballooned to the massive size of $3.82 billion. That’s well above average for schools of UIUC’s stature.

Some students have expressed concern about how the University fits that huge thing in its treasury. Anna remarked, “Not that I spend a lot of time looking down there, but if I did I’m sure I would see a huge bulge from trying to fit such a monstrous quantity of stuff in its confines.
